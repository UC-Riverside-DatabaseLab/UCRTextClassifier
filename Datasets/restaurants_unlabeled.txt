a little crowded but they move that line really fast
portions was just enough for me but may not be for a big eater
once you step into cosette youre miraculously in a small offthebeaten path parisian bistro
the service is good and the resturant is clean
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem
no pizza 33 for me
always busy but fast moving
service is friendly and never had a problem walking in and getting a table
over 100 different choices to create your own
ive been to over a dozen indian places in la and this is still my favorite
however if you want great food at a great price and dont mind the decor you cant beat this place
food was very good but not what i would consider out of this world
the open sesame combo plate is a bargain for the heap of food given
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine
server made several sake suggestions which were very good
the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places
the sushi here is perfectly good but for 5 a piece either the slices of fish should be larger or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant even for nyc
the sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick
just not good at all
awesome find
maybe it is good for that one night once in a blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish thats halfway decent
the foods as good as ever
and the waiter suggested a perfect sake
those rolls were big but not good and sashimi wasnt fresh
the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet we were told no
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides
the appetizer of oysters lobster crab small size made a perfect entre for my wife
my husband and i take out from here 34 times a month
thats a huge compliment especially in the fickled restaurant business enough already
mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta raddichio was kind of bitter though
as a fan of thai i have tried quite a few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst
zero ambiance to boot
however once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair sometimes you have to settle when its your only option i got through about half my kimchee before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin
on my meal i had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking and would have had to send them back again if i hadnt rejected the meal all together
when the bill came nothing was comped so i told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine but i didnt think i should have to pay for food with a maggot in it
i also ordered the change mojito which was out of this world
save room for scrumptious desserts
i liked it
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in a rage but we could hardly take her promise seriously seeing as she hadnt bothered to get the waitresses name
maybe it was the great company i had friends visiting from philly yes it was not a date this time or the super reasonable price point but i just cant say enough good things about this brasserie
they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice
while this diner had reasonably good food the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service
excellent atmosphere delicious dishes good and friendly service
there are so many other great places to go to eat and drink this place is not worth it
i lived on 50th st and wanted indian one day so decided to check this place out
i cant believe murphys has been around for over 25 years amazing
the staff is pretty friendly
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon which is just down the street on st marks and 1st ave
we will go back every time we are in the city
once you try it for a special occasion beware you cant stop
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude
i made my 1st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online
the lox is always fresh too
my wife and i always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have a story
the food is authentic italian delicious
i have been here spent tons of money on a chef special dinner and it was a major dissappointment
but the best pork souvlaki i ever had is the main thing
so about the prawns they were fresh and had a slight crispiness about the batter soooo good the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty
i go twice a month
i wish i could like this place more and i wish someone would retrain the staff
although the tables may be closely situated the candlelight foodquality and service overcompensate
told us to sit anywhere and when we sat he said the table was reserved
service is not exactly five star but thats not really a big deal
mioposto has a very creative delicious pizza menu
check this place out
dinners have always been excellent in terms of food quality
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood
i complained to the manager but he was not even apologetic
this place is pricey and yes the food is worth it but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price
patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff
their sake list was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which wasnt listed but made for us upon request
they even scoop it out nice for those on a diet not too much not to little
you want to have a real hot dog in brooklyn
highly recommended to all
believe it baby
less wait time for me
its to die for
have never had a problem with service save a missing rice once
go here for the drinks
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over how refreshing
the inhouse lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests
old school meets new world
im not necessarily fanatical about this place but it was a fun time for low pirces
maybe ill go back once more many years from now when ive forgotten i went there already
check out the art on the walls very colorful
we were very disappointed
all considered i have to say that rays boathouse is deserving of its title as a seattle institution
hidden little jem
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on 74th street which is 3 blocks away on 2nd ave
the sakes complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world
service was slow but the people were friendly
great survice
but too far east
highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night i had
i had lobster bisque it has 2 oz of maine lobster in it
there are no negatives to speak of
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions
aside from the sea urchin the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail boton shrimp blue fin torro fatty tuna sea eel etc
at this point the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and didnt say anything and guess what the waitress walked away
open cool place with the best pizza and coffee
there is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week
their crab eggs benedict is addicting
fair menu selection
but the staff was so horrible to us
they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls
try everything for that matter it is all good
for starters they delivered us someone elses order
gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
if youre planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since youll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky
bottles of wine are cheap and good
in short schooner or later couldnt have cared less about our being at their establishment
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything
best sushi ever
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one
they arent the most talkative but everytime ive been there they have been very busy which probably accounts for the lack of conversation
vanison was good but not amazing
i come from a family of pizzeria owners and im almost ashamed to say that the pizza in forninos blows my families receipies away
the design and atmosphere is just as good
mazing interior
i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty couldve used a bit more salt
our first time in new york and we had to try a new york bagel
none was made so i hung up
my husband and i have been sold on this from the first visit
overall the food quality was pretty good though i hear the salmon is much better when it hasnt sat cooling in front of the guest
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning
on a recent sunday afternoon a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt
the meat is fresh the sauces are great you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too
for desserts we tried the frozen black sesame mousse interesting but not extraordinary and matcha powdered green tea and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal
always busy but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service
everyone was more then happy with his choices
this is a twentysomething guy that doesnt mind laying down 300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions
as to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made
the food is here is incredible though the quality is inconsistent during lunch
by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant
ambience is delightful service impeccable
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples
great sushi experience
restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place
worst place on smith street in brooklyn
my gf and i dine at bukhara often as she lives near it
not only can the selection be innovative but theres a nice balance of traditional sushi as well
if you go try the marinaraarrabiatta sauce the mozzarella en carozza is mmmmmmmm everything is just delicious
great taste
also have great margaritas
for dinner i had the chicken tikkamasala and some garlic naan
too bad i had paid an extra 2 for the stone bowl
the food is wonderful tasty and filling and the service is professional and friendly
if youre going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage dont miss this one
the rolls are creative and i have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food
the price was right too
come on
blue ribbon lives up to its fantastic reputation
better than the bagel shop on the corner but not worth going out of your way for in my opinion
its a great place to enjoy food and meet friends
we dined at the colorado location today
the flavors robust and subtle
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant
for the people who want great food plus great service roxy is a place to avoid
the manager continually interrupted with is there anything else i can do for you a strange comment because she had hardly listened let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience
plenty of foodtrust me
great food
my roommate and i love this place
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year though
the wait staff is very freindly they make it feel like youre eating in a freindly little european town
terrible waste of money scammers
the hostess said wow thats a large group unless you arent together to which i replied no we are and there will be one more so a table for six please
the places decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh
try their chefs specials they are to die for
they have a delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as a great green tea tempura
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently
amma is nothing special
dont judge this place prima facie you have to try it to believe it a home away from home for the literate heart
the food was absolutely amazing
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian
had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona the cheeseburger huge and delictable and the service professional wan warm
also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling
2 egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal
while their kitchen food is delicious their sushi is out of this world
6 with tip
endless fun awesome music great staff
great food amazing service this place is a class act
the sushi is as fresh as it comesyoud think ocean was in their backyard no joke
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious
we were less than impressed
food was good and appetizing
i cant wait to go back
they have a wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from atlantic or pacific
i went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary
authentic korean food lovers should visit 32nd street of course
i think the stuff was better than disney
we love th pink pony
the food is good i cant lie
i though it was expensive and i prefer bella via just blocks away by far
i thought the restaurant was nice and clean
also they do not take credit card so come with cash
i dont usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but ill come to zenkichi anytime for a quiet unhurried and memorable dinner
im not kidding
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza as i love la pizza fresca
ill being with a couple of positives cool decor good pita and hummus and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty
the view is breathtaking the service is top notch the ambiance is wonderfull
its dark and cozy there is always jazz music playing when we go
really depends on your luck
but they do
dumbfoundingly poor
maybe it has improved since then
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold we were seated at one of the tables that was available 30 minutes ago
i decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed preshow dinner
always great service
place is open till late no dress code
i will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches
but ive heard a lot about this for the past 2 yrs and finally decided to eat here
quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried
go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience
not worth it
tiny dessert was 800just plain overpriced for what it is
and really large portions
i have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in
its located in a strip mall near the beverly center not the greatest location but the food keeps me coming back for more
ps please dont tell anyone in my family i eat there
every month if possible
make sure you try this place as often as you can
i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty
theres another girl who i cant describe she is about 56 with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what youre really talking about
the food is not what it once was potions have seriously seen downsizing prices have gone up and the service is the worst i have experienced anywhere including mainland europe
i was visiting socal a couple of months ago when the friend i was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant
sometimes i get bad food and bad service sometimes i get good good and bad service
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful
kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids
its a salad on top of pizza crust
there is a downside if youre ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude
its fresh welcoming delicious and relaxing
planet thai is great
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table
the entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need
the staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often
it is thick and slightly soggy
the pastas are incredible the risottos particularly the sepia are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing
the best thing is the prices are also quite reasonable
i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service
overall i would recommend it and go back again
chow fun was dry pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family
one of us actually liked the expresso thats it
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before its edible even when you order ahead
theyre are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing queens
a friend from seattle and i went on a thursday night around 830
im still mad that i had to pay for lousy food
during the course of the past 3 months the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the thirdbest thing about rays
i showed it to the manager and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for
appetizers took nearly an hour
the staff was accomodating the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely
lloovve this place
we paid and left because we didnt feel like arguing any more
guaranteed to be a tasty experience
the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
anyways if youre in the neighborhood to eat good food i wouldnt waste my time trying to find something rather go across the street to tamari
the atmosphere was great
we got most of it back at home with us
peppers onions relish chilli cheeses you name it
never again
i have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri
even though its good seafood the prices are too high
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back
i have never eaten in the restaurant however upon reading the reviews i got take out last week
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic
probably would not go again
i have been living in nyc for bit now and i have to say i love to go out and explore the scene
fish was overdone
it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects
when we stumbled on leon we thought that we had found quite the gem but we were certainly wrong
you cannot go wrong at the red eye grill
suan is a great place that i often take my friends classmates too
we never had to wait more than 5 minutes
and they give good quantity for the price
it is not consistent
the mussels were fantastic and so was the dessertdefinitely going to be back very soon
my girlfiends and i ate at og again last night
i was frankly shocked when i read the bad reviews this place is fantastic it has not let us down in any way and weve eaten here more than 10 times
its one of our favorite places to eat in ny
moules were excellent lobster ravioli was very salty
at first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint but at bark you dont just get your average hot dog
love pizza 33
subtle food and service
weve tried before but it always packed and doesnt take reservations
i had a great experience
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend asked him where are you frommaybe you dont know how things work in americaand in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on
i had the beef kabobs with a side of cucumber yogurt
i do not recommend
but for the shabu shabu you wont find much better in ny
its boring on the inside and our sushi was pretty below average the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor
the service was poor restaurant poorly lit staff not very attentive and i would have rather eaten at a mcdonalds than this joint
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine
what a tastly flaky treat
the entree was bland and small dessert was not inspired
great food and the prices are very reasonable
my family went on a midweek evening to have dinner
calling the place hampton chutney co does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too
each time weve been the front of house staff not the waiters theyre fantastic but the people who greet and seat you has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return
i am not a vegetarian but almost all the dishes were great
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience
i have reservations about the all you can eat deal however the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than 18 by just going off the menu
groovy music made the dinner casual
the service is amazing ive had different waiters and they were all nice which is a rare thing in nyc
prices are very good
before the steak came the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested i pick something from the menu
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company youre with
however the value and service are both severely lacking
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives
i went to this restaurant with a woman that i met recently
one of my favorite places in brooklyn
open late well as late as i ever got there and im a night person
spreads and toppings are great though a bit pricey
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary
remind me of home
paul the maitre d was totally professional and always on top of things
however go for the ambience and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world
rather than eating the meat entree being offered i requested a vegetarian dish
dont miss blooms on your next trip to manhatten
the chana masala garbanzo beans are also excellent
would never go back
we order a bit of everything on the menu
i think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked
we were very pleasantly surprised
just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and thats all the service i need
fantastic
i have worked in restaurants and cook a lot and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food
murray wont do it
the wine list is also really nice
we were then shooed inside
this place blew me awayby far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel but they are definitely one you dont want to miss esp if your in downtown san jose
supercilious scorn is in
it is set far from the small street its on and there is no traffic noise
again id be super upset if that were my employee
but when we looked at the menu there werent a lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section
a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner
we went to ino for valentines
the upside of the restaurant
too bad the food wasnt of the same heritage
esp during happy hour
delicious creative and fun
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up but save room for dessert
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and i had that signature msg taste lingering in my throat after i left the restaurant
the location is perfect
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service
i come here enjoy very much with husband
we are locals and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably onetime customer tourists
cant wait wait for my next visit
a few tips skip the turnip cake roast pork buns and egg custards
best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town
i have been going there since it opened and i cant get enough
it is expensive but well worth the money
too large for just two people but nothing was left
170 down the toilet
if youre in the area you shouldnt be disappointed
doesnt get any better than that
the food is delicious from the specials to the regular menufare the dishes are never a disappointment
favorite sushi in nyc
best restaurant in brooklyn
this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer
but overall i give it a 10
i love this place
how is this palce still open
leon is an east village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic french bistro fare good specials a warm and lively atmosphere
yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously but it shouldnt
also there was only one bathroom stall probably need more for such big crowds
our experience did not ever get any better
you must try the shrimp appetizers
great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table
a cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer
amazing my favorite
love the enchiladas and chicken soup and be sure to check out their specials
the pizza itself is not exactly the best ive had ever but still pretty good
thank you emilio
i would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation if possible
for each course we waited over 12 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink
thats a big statement considering ive been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since i was about seven but something about these little devils gets better every time
dessert pure disaster
it was steamed and tossed with garlic
great atmosphere
love al di la
the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes
by far the best bar in the east village
not alot of smoking places left in new york but i have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city
really i find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowdsthis in the city of a million restaurants at least 910 of which are way better than this one
on that scale its a worldbeater
guess what i waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says oh well i wish you would have said something earlier no apology nothing
the first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was a little bland
nice atmosphere the service was very pleasant and the desert was good
i highly recommend cafe st barts for their food the ambience and wonderful service
great indian food
the prices are outrageous especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood chinese establishments
but once done its not too much dough not too much cheese not too much sauce
however they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone
despite a slightly limited menu everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and a work of food art
service was kind of slow our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it wasnt that busy
ive also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years a new jazz bar the most fantastic dining garden the best thin crust pizzas and now a lasagna menu which is to die for these are not your average lasagnas
just because its cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty it is great
never had one single problem there
the steak tartare is a great bet they fix it for you at the table
the food however is what one might expect
i live a block away and go to patsys frequently
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable
look the appetizers were really good
going to bark is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy
sit in the balcony
unique apppetizers
i guarantee you wont be disappointed theres also valet parking
great food better margaritas
great food great decor great service
it has great sushi and even better service
i love it
its just a fun place to go not a five star restaraunt
good experience
the chicken lollipop is my favorite most of the dishes i have to agree with a previous reviewer are quite oily and very spicy espeically the chilli chicken
besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city
i would recommend reservations on weekends though
ragas is a romantic cozy restaurant
love yuka
our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great
we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish
just moved to the neighborhood and weve been trying all the west village sushi restaurants
the bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the free appetizer of olives was disappointing
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle
dokebi gives williamsburg the right onetwo punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos
i asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like i was insane
my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible
the place is a bit hidden away but once you get there its all worth it
planet thailand has always been a hit with me i go there usually for the sushi which is great the thai food is excellent too
entrees vanison steak and bison steak
the service was excellent the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding
service was very good prompt attentive and nonintrusive
the decor is vibrant and eyepleasing with several semiprivate boths on the right side of the dining hall which are great for a date
what more can you ask for
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town
the best calamari in seattle
slightly above average wines start at 70 with only one selection listed at 30
im not picky but it was actually gross
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets and then ordered for them
this is a great place to take outoftowners and perfect for watching the sunset
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesnt work
service was wonderful
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc
it costs 2 extra to turn a regular roll into an insideout roll but the roll more than triples in size and thats not just from the rice
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another
everyone seemed generally happy with their food except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice
seattles best winelist
its served with either a peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction though both were indistinguishable in taste
hats off to the chef
after sitting there with my empty glass for over 20 minutes i left
growing up in ny i have eaten my share of bagels
the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly
food was luke warm
where can i begin
when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else
always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer
i found it on a cold night the perfect spot to warm up
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth
it is terrific as is the value
delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week
i definitely wouldnt go back
go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead
good sake selection
most of the servers are very attentive friendly and quite attractive
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that itd be a 30 minute wait
we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have a short wait
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering the food here was decent not great
we live nearby bfc
got a date go here
you can get a table without a reservation if you get there early i they dont make you by bottles
molto bene
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair
the owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for
this place is a must visit
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings
if youre daring try the balsamic vinegar over icecream its wonderful
if you dont mind presliced low quality fish unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place
everything and i mean everything on the menu is delectable
way overrated
this is my must bring out of town guests to restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it
we had a very hard time getting the waitress attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager
that is a must but not every restaurant can do
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received
worth the wait
i have been going back again and again
this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area
i recommend it for a night when you want to splurge it was a bit expensive
when i called this morning i didnt think i would be able to get in at 12 but i was able to get in along with four other guests
one would think wed get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got a snobby waiter wouldnt even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
so if youre walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see whos going to be seating you first
it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips
weve found it to be better and fresher than kiku which is comparable in price
rays suprisingly has the citys best most diverse wine list
we ate out in the back patio which is worth it as its cool and the music is hear well there
i dont know if ill be back
cool atmosphere the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night
best reuben sandwich ever
for instance plates were just dumped on the table i was handed the wine list upside down etc
first of all dal bukhara rocks
awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive
not because you are the four seasons you are allowed to charge an arm and a leg for a romatic dinner
service ok but unfriendlyfilthy bathroom
we stood there for 10 minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us
on the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues
i would highly recommand requesting a table by the window
i found a new home and just moved with a long lease
we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right
ive never ordered anything else from their menutheres no need to
the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order
service is average
i liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price
first it took us a long time to find the place
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation
the band was very good and the service was attentive
the steak was done to my exact liking medium rare and was nice and juicy
the wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to italy
ive had the lunch buffet at chennai a couple of times when i have been in the neighborhood
serves really good sushi
be sure to try the oyster roll
the sashimi was the freshest and most tender i have ever tasted
i fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork
the ambience was nice but service wasnt so great
i swore never to return for a warm beer and mediocre meal
the portions are huge so it might be good to order three things to split rather than one appetizer and entree per person for two people
bukhara grill the tagline says it all indian spice rave
not impressed with the food
also specify if you like your food spicy its rather bland if you dont
best taiwanese food in ny
a word to the wise you cant dine here and disturb the maitreds sense of table turnover as whacked as it is or else
its a little out of the way if you dont live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are
highly recommended
we liked it so much that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york
lol
i completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date
this is a fun restaurant to go to
the place is the next best thing to my moms cooking
yes they use fancy ingredients but even fancy ingredients dont make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right
the waitress seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
but the space is small and lovely and the service is helpful
and ive been to many nyc delis
fresh mind blowing flavors
whose writing all the great reviews
good luck getting a table
i am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at rays boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations
the salads are delicious both refreshing and very spicy
the omlette for brunch is great
the hot dogs are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect on its supermarket squishy bun
hurleys is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came
i may not be a sushi guru but i can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it
what we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received
it was one of the few places in socal where you would actually walk around and not have to take a car
and it all comes at a very reasonable price congee noodles and rice dishes are no more than 36 each
with the theater 2 blocks away we had a delicious meal in a beautiful room
ambiance relaxed and stylish
i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll
i wasnt here for the pizza so i cant comment on that yet but what i had was very good
i would highly recommend this place
and the best summertime deck experiencethey will even bring you a blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather
be aware
we had a very nice time
my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a threeyear old with no sense of proportion or flavor
very good wine choices
there were no communications issues either as she spoke perfect english
easily the worst stirfried squid ive ever tasted
so rude
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy
my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food
service not the friendliest to our large party
the blond wood decor is very soothing the premium sake is excellent and the service is great
we ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken all dark meat and on the bone
i couldnt ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table
i was so stunned and i left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing
sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance
weve lived in the area for more than 8 years
five of us walked in at approximately 620 on a thursday evening
this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards
the drinks are amazing and half off till 8pm
she doesnt make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance
big thumbs up
located at the end of a magnificent block
there is no excuse for such lousy service
save your money and your time and go somewhere else
the food was good too
also they were 15 each
lebanese foodyum
definitely has one of the best jukeboxs ive seen in a long long time
myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else
try sushimi cucumber roll
at first we were a little taken aback as this seemed to present a problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us
mediocre servicequality
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque
i recently went to this restaurant with some coworkers for lunch and had an amazing time
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion maybe 3 of each
though its been crowded most times ive gone here bark always delivers on their food
in fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment
after telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar
please take my advice go and try this place
i highly recommend the sophia pizza
have the iced tea
this establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of chow foods group
lexicographers take note a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn
great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks
i book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot
all in all were already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks
limited menu nosofresh ingredients thinlysliced fish fallapart rice
best of all is the warm vibe the owner is super friendly and service is fast
this place is charming and relaxing
looking around i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen
i did not try the caviar but i tried their salmon and crab salad they are all good
snotty attitude
to the owners of open sesamebravoi cant wait to come back to dine at your restaurant
nice family owned traditional restaurant
for my entreacutee i completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard artichoke hearts fennel and pecorino toscano
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant the food
not one to jump to complaints hence my lack of previous online reviewing i called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations
it is simply amazing
still i would recommend this place
how do you rate home
just straight up cheap good food
overall i would go back and eat at the restaurant again
best restaurant in the world great decor great customer service friendly manager
my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time
go here
the wife had the risotto which was amazing
in a age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants its nice to see a place that bucks that trend and just plain delivers high quality food and good service period
restaurant with a view
ive had better chicken at bbqs
too bad latin quarters closed
southglenn is largest location
the atmosphere isnt the greatest but i suppose thats how they keep the prices down
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily
unbelievable
and where does patis go wrong no where
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans
fantastic place
the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing
wish ny had more of these kind of places intimate superb food homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait
what may be interesting to most is the worst seviceattitude comes from the owners of this establishment
hands down the best tuna i have ever had
we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night
i would highly recommend it
caution its real food for people who love the best
this place is not worth the prices
amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi that eel with avodcao um um um
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa
no really
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better
as part of a small party of four our food was dropped off without comment
service was prompt and courteous
sauce was watery and the food didnt have much flavor
everything is always cooked to perfection the service is excellent the decor cool and understated
delicate spices onions eggs and a kickass roti
its very spicy but not offensive
how to describe the best sushi in nyc hmmmm delicious amazing fantastic suculent perfect nah all of the above
food wise its ok but a bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant isnt a fancy place
overall decent food at a good price with friendly people
but 500 for a dinner for two that didnt include wine
if youre interested in good tasting without the fish taste or smell large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale
we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their 35 menu
thank you everyone at waters edge
we will definitely go back
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with a high brow menu
i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible
terrible would be a compliment
the dosas are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally id drink popcorn topping before id eat another one of these
great financial district mexican spot
the atmosphere is relaxed and casual
there have been several occasions when weve just not gotten some side dishes weve ordered
we arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy
it is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat
ive been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine if not good
with the great variety on the menu i eat here often and never get bored
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention
but 1 for each small piece
the pizza and wine were excellentthe service toobut what really made this place was the backyard dining area
this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york
way below average
i like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent
its a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food
be prepared to wait because the place is pretty tiny
i really recommend the very simple unda egg rolls
stay away
great food with an awesome atmosphere
ive waited over one hour for food
the hot dogs are top notch and theyre slamwich is amazing
enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheeseboth very tasty
the sandwiches are dry tasteless and way overpriced
nice food but no spice
two complaints their appetizer selection stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu
i would recommend roxys for that but not for their food
a group of 5 of us went there for sunday brunch and sat outside
after all that they complained to me about the small tip
ive eaten at many different indian restaurants
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi
less than three minutes passed before i found myself doubled over the toilet
bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world blue ribbon sushi
it was pretty inexpensive too
the food here was mediocre at best
its a great place to order from or sitin
in fact many want to return a second time during their visit
we replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay
its very reasonably priced esp for the quality of the food
so eat fast and order a lot
wine list is extensive without being overpriced
the best place for a leisure sunday breakfast amidst yachts then take a stroll through the nearby farmers market
pacifico is a great place to casually hang out
oh speaking of bathroom the mens bathroom was disgusting
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent
among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants this offers by far one of the best values for your money
i read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and i thought to myself but may be it is worth it
we love the food drinks and atmosphere
this is a great place to get a delicious meal
we ordered the special grilled branzino that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat
we thought the dessert would be better wrong
mmmmm it was delicious
watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush thats more lemony than smoky
sometimes you pay a lot and dont get much in return its manhattan things are expensive
this is the kind of place youd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret
the waiter was a bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded
yakitori bbq meats is tasty too
have recommended the place to friends always gets good response
i dont appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patrons knowledge so that was a huge turnoff more than the price
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that but their menu was so unique that i continued
the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny
overrated
my boyfriend had prime rib it was good
1 oclock in the morning
i go out to eat and like my courses servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink
the only positive thing about mioposto is the nice location
bukhara is on my top 5 indian places in nyc
so i decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible
they are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread
im a born and bred southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening
this guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel including paris that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant
i grew up on these bagels
fancy pieces of exotic fish on a 100 dollar plate and not one was eatable
i wish i could be refunded
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu
great food spectacular location and friendly service keep us coming back year after year
i cant believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food
the drinks are great especially when made by raymond
atmosphere is nice and relaxed too
the food is fantastic authentic delicious and very very affordable
i went here for a family birthday dinner
my friends and i were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by a friend
dont go to this place
sunday afternoons there is a band playing and it is lots of fun
next time we will go somewhere else or try other restaurants close by like mimis cafe and claim jumper
try green curry with vegetables
i have lived in japan for 7 years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan
the stuff tilapia was horridtasted like cardboard
when i got there i sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy the service was horrible
i was very disappointed with this restaurant
the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns the few they actually give youwere not good
i was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table
at 120 for two people however this in no way represents value unless youre looking to pay by the hour for passiveaggressive torture
this place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service
we waited for an hour to be seated
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world
if youve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer
definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date
ive been here twice now
the fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced
from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it
the staff is very good
highly recommend it
get the pepperoni yum and a family style salad
you should travel from the bronx to try it
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin
i had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations
great spot whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner
bison was quite excellent however
thius is a must for anyone who loves shabushabu
from the street it looks very hidden and is actually an old warehouse
delivery is fast too
my boyfriend and i are avid restaurant goers and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms
the servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful
always good drinks and service is pretty good
we could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu
sometimes tables dont understand his sense of humor but its refreshing to have a server who has personality professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner
i would not expect this for a 55 dinner
i went here on a recommendation and will surely return time and time again
so delicious
the rice to fish ration was also goodthey didnt try to overpack the rice
always a nice crowd but never loud
i mentioned the squid dish wasnt very good when the waitress visited
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it
also a little more expensive than your average bagel place
i have eaten at some of the best sushi joints in nyc nobu bond street jewelbako etc and yamato is my favorite
yum
a beautifully designed dreamy egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it
yes the prices are high but i felt it was worth it
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef
i have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst
eating in the atmosphere saves it but at your desk its a very disappointing experience
it is also extremely well priced
the lobster knuckles special of the day were ok but pretty tasteless
when asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not mcdonalds every place makes things differently
the only problem would be the wait but we usually just have a drink in the front while waiting
yummy
good fast service
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods
no gimmicks here the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation
skip dessert
this is the case at this gem
i thought i had died and gone to heaven
everyone must come here at least once
we paid a fixed pricce but got nothing
all their menu items are a hit and they serve mimosas
ive never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious
our teenage kids love it too
big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment
love the scene first off the place has a character and nice light to itvery fortunate location wise
the restaurant was packed at first so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated
i literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time
what else can you say nice people amazing food wow
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden
i recieved prompt service with a smile
the food is great the bartenders go that extra mile
great shabu shabu
taxan delicious
drinks 2 glasses of dom perignon at 35 each
were cant say enough about their delicious gourmet pizzas
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks
i am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food but my friend who took me there is
went there for an office lunch
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better
wont come back again for sure
prefer to order it and pick it up though because i dont like the servers one young woman in particular
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasnt even fully melted
while finishing our meals which included a highend bottle of wine our sons fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert
when you add it all together it just doesnt seem worth it to meespecially considering the prices
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food this is one of the best spots
we were then charged for their most expensive sake 20 per serving when we in fact drank a sake of less than half that price
wont or cant is not in the service directory
this place is great
service here was great food was fantastic
the owner is belligerent to guests that have a complaint
an unpretentious spot in park slope the sushi is consistently good the service is pleasant effective and unassuming
the food arrived 20 minutes after i called cold and soggy
i know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places but miopostos pizza lacks quality and good taste
eat at your own risk
can get busy on fridays for a table but once seated the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly
this place has totally weird decor stairs going up with mirrored walls i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional
i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try
the sushi was awful
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit
the restaurant was busy however there were a few tables open
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look theyre perfect for 2 people
the place has a nice fitout some attractive furnishings and from what i could tell a reasonable wine list i was given the food menu when i asked for the carte des vins
i never heard back from anyone more than a month ago
if you venture off the island of manhattan and cant seem to find a great italian restaurant drive to corona
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome great appetizer to share
casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian
have been several times and it never dissapoints
i really enjoyed my meal here
i have eaten here a handful of times for no reason besides sheer convenience
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising
i love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
great for a romantic evening or a fun evening with friends
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation
ive enjoyed 99 of the dishes weve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional tooauthenticforme dish im a daring eater but not that daring
a quintessential slice of nyc pizza
first of all henrymillionare you dont know a thing about middle eastern food so dont talk
everytime i decide to try another place on the ues i get angry that i didnt just go to zucchero pomodori
ive been to at cafe spice probably 58 times it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors
i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever
the bibimbap was average but the stone bowl wasnt even close to sizzling
i will have to do more research before checking out new places based on diners driveins and dives reviews
and 11 for a plate of bland guacamole
i lived in maine for ten years and grew up on fish
not cheap but very yummy
ive been many time and have never been disappointed
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent but the gyro is the reason to comeif you dont eat one your trip was wasted
overpriced
i loved it and would go again
best dining experience in the west village
fine i wont hang you for that
i found the food to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish i had
never too crowded and always great service
what a hassle
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york
this place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi
the service was excellent and the food was delicious
great bagels spreads and a good place to hang out in
the food is good especially their more basic dishes and the drinks are delicious
staff is very accomodating
great pizza poor service
and the upstairs is a great place to hang out
this is where it really really gets bad the manager said there is absolutely nothing we can do its a matter of taste that she didnt like it and i cannot comp it
we got a little tipsy from the sake but isnt that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about
the only downside they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time
a weakness is the chicken in the salads
cant believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients
i had my eyes on this place promising myself i will one day give it a try
the price very reasonable
this is the first place ive been that a runner remembers my order hope he likes his job because i have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant
service was just ok it is not what youd expect for 500
the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree
hands down the best pizza on the planet
not the place it once was
this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent
food was ok
excellent food nice ambience fairly expensive
the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm
i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food
here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available
had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on a tuesday morning but it was so worth it
the floor was wet the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor no soap and no hand towels left
to sum it up service varies from good to mediorce depending on which waiter you get generally it is just average ok
seabass on lobster risotto was the best
some pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all
the food is decent
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem
seafood plus
went here on a friends reccomendation
haru on park s is simply disgusting
love it
when we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost
however i think this place is a good hang out spot
this is the best shabushabu restaurant in the trystate area
quacamole at pacifico is yummy as are the wings with chimmichuri
will prob not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once
we asked for beverages and never received them
the dessert we had a pear torte was good but once again the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions
be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials
we were offered water for the table but were not told the voss bottles of water were 8 a piece
unhygienic
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it
the dinner was ok nothing i would have again
the food is outstanding and the service is quick friendly and very professional
go there once and oh yesyou will go backyou will
im not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy mizu very much and were repeat customers
skip this restaurant its a big disappointment
over the years the host vittorio and his crew have always treated me as familyalthough with all the business this notsolittle gem does it amazing hes even able to remember a consistent but notsofrequent visitor
one of the best if not the best restaurants in park slope and ny in general
moving on
veal parmigana better than patsys
this place has great indian chinese food
i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested
even the chickpeas which i normally find too dry were good
iwe will never go back to this place again
service is top notch
the signs the specials menus food and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese
just awsome
the food is very good but not outstanding
it was well worth the wait
worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store
i love their thai
other guests enjoyed pizza santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips
try the pad thai or sample anything on the appetizer menutheyre all delicious
i was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a friday night because she had a bbq to go to that night wtf
would never go back there
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong it actually means great prosperity
we were quickly seated and requested the special dinner which came with 1 shellfish and shrimp appetizer or caesar salad 2 9 oz steak with a single potato chip and 3 homemade donut holes
for the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best nyc has to offer the fish is the freshest and the service is superb
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace
good sushi high price
the fried dumplings are great
two thumbs up
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn
definately check it out
eggs pancakes potatoes fresh fruit and yogurt everything they serve is delicious
but the service was a bit slow
she then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables
after that she simply took our plates walked away came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty
you need to watch your game they will have it on for you
i asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere
i had the kafta plate and i enjoyed it
the baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best weve ever had
having hunted around for a quiet romantic yet not hideously expensive restaurant i stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it a shot
to start off approximately 810 oz of orange juice will cost you 3
a great place to meet up for some food and drinks
the pancakes should be larger at least 8 to justify the expense even with the unique offerings
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city
great wine selection gigondas is worth the price and the house champagne is a great value
even my indian friend couldnt believe how good and tasty everything was
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices
we wont go to this place again for a good meal
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time
the service was courteous and attentive
i would never recommend this place to anybody even for a casual dinner
great staff
my husband and i both ordered the steak medium
food was okay nothing great
be sure not to get anything other than bagels
this place was reccomended to me by a friend
my friends spoke so much about it for months i finally made the time to come down ear and dine in
the scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique not to mention tasty
i had a taste of all three items on her plate and they were superb
the food options rule
the pancakes were certainly inventive but 850 for 3 6 pancakes one of them was more like 5 in the pancake flight sample of 3 different pancakes is well overpriced
10
if you go here do it on his offnight
the wait staff is very courteous and accomodating
it just wasnt thai
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere
food was amazing i love indian food and eat it quite regularly but i can say this is one of the best ive had
reliable fresh sushi
i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others
i thought going to jimmys would give me a real domincan exprience
just want to warn you all dont waste your time and money
however its the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth
a little pricey but it really hits the spot on a sunday morning
it gets really busy so get there on the early side so you can grab a seat if you do have to wait its not bad because the service is quick
unless you are just stopping in for a few drinks i wouldnt recommend going here
the pizzas are not huge and the crust is thinkeep that in mind when youre ordering
this was my frist time at cafe st barts and i must say how delicous the food and the service was
try the sea bass
food took some time to prepare all worth waiting for
delivery guy sometimes get upset if you dont tip more than 10
its just the right size for the menu
we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday and i was thoroughly impressed with the food
even if the food wasnt this good the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila
i agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience
i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read
the food is a diamond in rough the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes
im astonished that this restaurant is categorized as rather than
pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown
they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great
first of all this place is not romantic as claimed by citysearchs editorial review
this place is famous for their breakfast
the combination of superfresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious
i have tried to make reservations but both times the hostess didnt have my name
though one thing i realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or a meat tenderizer on the steak
all in all i would return as it was a beautiful restaurant but i hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future
the pasta was well cooked didnt have enough sauce though or flavor
personally i like the margherita pizza better but they are all good
btw i really like long beach
the bar drinks were eh ok to say the least
enjoyed the food
are you freaking kidding me
everything on the menu is great
you can easily hear him though so it was a pleasant sound and not overbearing
i got the 10 10piece dim sum combo every bite of which was great
this placegod where do i begin
completely over rated
to be honest ive had better frozen pizza
the food was amazing and the service was prompt and helpful but not overbearing or rushed
a real dissapointment
i was literally going to explode but instead my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager
the sommelier is fantastic downtoearth extremely knowlegable
in summereat outside on a terrace another great feature of suan
service was quick
i like the ambience its very dark and original
seriously you cant go wrong if it is unpretentious local fun you seek
i have eaten a lot of pizza here
i appreciate their delivery too
cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at 10
delectable
everything about this restaurant was special
i just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for a private party cant wait to celebrate my next birthday there
add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening
oh and the cheese fries are awesome
the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals
toons has recently been redone so its now a very attractive space
the food was great and tasty but the sitting space was too small i dont like being cramp in a corner
i will be back
the only thing more wonderful than the food which is exceptional is the service
i have not a bad thing to say about this place
cut to the chase this is amazing
the pepperonis cut real thickyum
every time 0sixtynine is called the bartender buys everyone drinks
the naan was some of the best ive had and i really enjoyed the bhartha not too tomatoey
i have been twice to this restaurant
not a very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food
the only thing the waiters dont do for you is wipe your chin when you leave
the place is a lot of fun
first off the food came fast and all together i like that i hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other
i look forward to eating here again
polite acknowledgement is out
ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before and toons is by far the best thai food ive had except for my moms of course
i love dungeness crabs and at rays you can get them served in about 6 different ways
not a great place for family or general dining
for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower
chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top
she just nodded and walked off
wine list selection is good and winebytheglass was generously filled to the top
its alright
such a disappointment
in fact there is only one ive tried that even compares shabu tatsu and even then i prefer dokebi
i know because i live nearby
its a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early
fresh ingrediants and super tasty
oh yeahthe view was good too
very affordable and excellent ambient
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner
the staff is no nonsense
i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks
you will not be disapointed at all
after we ate our appetizers which took all of 8 minutes we ordered another round of brahmas and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member
love this place every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go
if there is a line very day of the week for the entire time a place is open you know it is great
its all about the food
great pizza for lunch place
not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food
the food and service were fine however the maitred was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant
its somewhere you can eat and be happy
we went around 930 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great
i have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent
the food was good the place was clean and affordable
the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd but there were a few groups of mid 20s30 year olds also
when we finally were able to flag someone down it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food who was also not the same person who had taken our order
the crust is thin the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner
trust me
the caesar salad i ordered had so much lemon i couldnt eat it
i cant
i really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi on saffron risottoyum
went on a 3 day oyster binge with fish bringing up the closing and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended because it was so great
the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious
i asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if i like uni
i will never return
this is one of my top lunch spots huge portions fast service and amazing margaritas
even the pasta is delicious here a rarity in new york pizza restaurants
foodawesome
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans
we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
i ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor
pizza was a little soggy
the food was delicious i had a halibut special my husband had steak and the service was topnotch
the food tasted very good
the food was ok but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn
need i say more
service was also very good
the entree was also very good
great pizza and fantastic service
of course it is crowded but who cares
their calzones are horrific bad vomitinducing yuck
we called the other person who was very close by and she told us to order for her so we did
and it was quick which is very important
both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service which was boarderline rude
the dishes offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream the best and freshest ive ever had
the cream cheeses are out of this world and i love that coffee
i had the lamb special which was perfect
there was a guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area
ask for usha the nicest bartender in manhattan
also waiters try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost
never fails to please
more williamsburg garbage
again no apology no is there anything else i can get you no can i get you a drink to make up for it nothing
the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic
i think ive had some the best meals of my life at minnow
next time we wouldnt dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious and we splurged on the shilshole samplera beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns smoked albacore tuna rays fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill scallops in a tasty soy dressing and a tiny pile of dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce
excellent dumplings served amid clean chic decor
after 12 years in seattle rays rates as the place we always go back to
many people talk about the great pizza and poor service so it cant just be the rantings of a few dissatisfied customers
yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much
i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation
as we were leaving the couple standing by the door said to another waiter were not in a hurry
the service was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
we did have the same waiter the second time so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good
my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos
the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side
on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal
the lunch menu is an awesome deal
we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food
very good
the food now is inconsistent
i heartily recommend
it was decent but nothing exceptional
if we were to move from the upper east side we would genuinely miss this restaurant
this place is incredibly tiny
go to open sesame
i would highly recommend
the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service
the food is great and reasonably priced
i went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian
consistently good japanese tapas
the atmosphere is aspiring and the decor is festive and amazing
i wont go back unless someone else is footing the bill
we used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing
all the people that i bring there go back on their own and bring their friends
the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce even its low sodium the vinegarsoaked rice and the scallion on top of the fish
gross food wow
you cant say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown
the space is limited so be prepared to wait up to 45 minutes 1 hour but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indochinese food
ive been to this restaurant over a dozen times with no complaints to date
you are likely to be disappointed
nothing really came across as outstanding
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka
it was served with skin over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes
great drinks corn beef hash coffee b fast burritos gluten free menu
to top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant
the family seafood entree was very good
i recommend this place to everyone
oh and theres hookah
only complaint is the pricingi believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu
i went there with my friend last saturday
since we were already waiting so long we felt we had no other choice but to accept it
i havent been to the other locations
best indian chinese in the city by far
green tea creme brulee is a must
best mexican place for lunch in the financial district
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there
melt in your mouth
good creative rolls
great service
authentic pakistani food
great food great wine list great service in a great neighborhood
still we keep going back
good food
the food was very good filet mignon was probably the best ive ever try
there was no tap beer that evening which was a disappointment
the food is yummy especially their cookedtoperfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries
we all ordered different entrees so we could share
everything you want and more very fresh
ciao bella
i attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food was majorly disappointing
as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic
beautiful experience
fabulous italian food
it hits the spot every time
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so i try to ignore it
my party had the bbe 29 fixe prix menu which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat
one of the best
we were 10 people celebrtating a birthday we sat in the tent
it isnt the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time
and the tom kha soup was pathetic
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and i wish cafe noir would get some good staff because despite the current one this is a great place
but not in a good way
i looove their eggplant pizza as well as their pastas
food was good and cheap
i was visiting new york city with a friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant
slightly on the pricey side but worth it
the atmosphere was just okay
get the tuna of gari
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant
while its not nobu it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food better then places like balthazar etc
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
service is not what you are coming here for
the wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings
our food was great too
very normal indian food but done really well
the food is sinful
great lunch spot
ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away
do not get the go go hamburgers no matter what the reviews say
this establishment really made a marked decline after and this is recurring story the airing of food televisions diners driveins and dives hosted by guy fieri in which schooner or later was subject of
super yummy pizza
i recommend the jelly fish drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings certainly the stir fry blue crab
the portions are big though so do not order too much
im not even going to bother to describe it it speaks for itself
my favortie pizza joint in seattle
the food was bland oily
for those of you who dont know uni is sea urchin in japanese which happens to be my favorite
my bf and i go to the walkup counter and order a pie
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy service was great and the food was excellent
i dont think i would go again
the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal
i was in love with pongsri on 48th but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods
one of my favorite places in manhattan
best chinese food i have tasted in a long time
i paid just about 60 for a good meal though
the food was all good but it was way too mild
i have known about this secret for the last 13 years emiliothe godfather has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices
best indian restaurant in the city
immediately after we paid the waiter took the money and said okay you guys are outta here
food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on a foggy rainy day like that of when i went
it was divine melts in your mouth
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the bts
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive
the menu looked great and the waiter was very nice but when the food came it was average
we left without ever getting service
they charge different prices all the time
im saving up for my next visit
my fav was the sassy lassi
ive been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences
weve lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there
expensive
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is 1
the service is ok some of the people didnt get what they asked for
in the summer months the back garden area is really nice
we were seated right away the table was private and nice
check out the secret back room
price is high but the food is good so i would come back again
please dont fool us
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner
well i guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay a visit to tutta bella in columbia city for some tips
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin which was heavenly at sushi rose
anybody who likes this place must be from a different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary
in other words if they arent making off of you then you dont rate high on their service scale
i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there
perfection
the best pad thai ive ever had
i have been to raos probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better
caesar salad was superb
salads are a delicious way to begin the meal
not recommanded
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners
only drawback they wont toast your bagel and they dont make eggs for the bagel
freshest sushi i love this restaurant
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and nonexistent customer service
without the wait or attitude i would probably go back but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and dont make me jump through hoops
being serious sushi lovers we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action
they were such a ripoff 895 for four small meat patties in steamed buns and not worth trying
the only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent
our server was very helpful and friendly
never have i had such dramatic delivery guys a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath bc i live in a walkup who always seem disappointed with their tips
its delicious
portions contain less fish than one would expect particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in nyc masa excluded of course
arigato gozimas yuka
i had their eggs benedict for brunch which were the worst in my entire life i tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was
a fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes flatbush farm isnt in the same league as the blue hills or even the farm on adderlys of the world but its pretty good albeit with a somewhat dismal setting
another review here claimed the prefix was 29per person including sake but it is 55 per person not including sake
i dont understand how i was a stranger to this place for so long the fajita salad the colorado the fajitas everything is delicious
plus i am allergic to rice and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating didnt even bat an eye
there is only one place on the east coast that has it all plus a lot more
excellent
you can get a completely delish martini in a glass thats about 2 12 drinks for 850 i recommend the vanilla shanty mmmm in a great homey setting with great music
we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
the food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach
for all you lazy folks that dont want to come to alphabet city i say good stay out
we didnt look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately i think that may have been part of the problem
i came across village underground by accident now i go there all the time
i went there with a friend from out of town and we were both very impressed
the food was exceptional
everything ive had here is good taco salads burritos enchiladas i love this place
as many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time
the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre
had an awful experience at casa la femme on a saturday dinner
when im feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office i head for cafe st barts
i think i have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent
ive had the jellyfish horse mackerel blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others and they were all good
my wife also ordered a teapot of hot water she had a sore throat and i guess that since it was only water it wasnt a priority for them to actually bring it
i went here with a friend on a whim we went someplace else first and couldnt get a table
all the staff is absolutely professional
we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore
they were dry and disgusting i didnt even finish my first piece
the side of potatoes is to die for as is the labne yogurt dip
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish
the restaurant was 80 full and there was a sign posted wait to be seated
i didnt want to go there because of the reviews and prices i saw on the internet
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile
the wine list is extensive and impressive
just remember the later you go the longer you may have to wait
my father had the flank steak which was very good and my mother had the swordfish
the waiter was attentive
i know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is im here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking a pleasant experience
the food here does a great service to the name cantonese that is
pizza here is consistently good
just remember to dress a little urbanchic so you dont look too far out of place
i recommend it
this place had all the trimmings and i mean all
i should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild
the seafood is amazing theres a good wine list and the everchanging menu always offers some great surprises
the prices are wonderfully low
we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly
excellent food for great prices
so for the after beach excursion we thought we would end the day on a high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet
considering you will spend at least 60 a head i expect better service
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes
ive always found the wait staff and if you sit at the bar the cooks very friendly
i had the best ravioli ever
we easily spent more than 40 per person not including alcohol and were still hungry
the characters really make for an enjoyable experience
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent
normally places ask how hot you want it but they didnt
the staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful
i noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is a great sign for an indian place
this place we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend
drinks were good
donot go
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait for a table
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side
i visit new green bo when i have money or when i am broke
avoid the place
i take all my nyc guests to vts
i will never forget the amazing meal service and ambiance i experience at this restaurant
also its great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place the service its just perfecttheyre so frendly that we never want to live the place
it was like dining at a completely different restaurant
theres nice and quiet small but enough for 6 or more
food is great
i have never been so disgusted by both food an service
dungeness crabs here
im glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chipsgood but a far cry from what the name implies
i never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it
our waitress wasnt mean but not especially warm or attentive either
the food was very good a great deal and the place its self was great
they have it all great price food and service
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
do not try unless youre just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste
best meal in a long time
you fellas above says its the best taiwanese restaurant in town
the place was quiet and delightful
consequently their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they didnt feel like finishing them
we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and 4th streets and joya is the best
our drinks kept coming but our server came by a couple times
1 turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st just south of bayard
also i personally wasnt a fan of the portobello and asparagus mole
i loved it and would highly recommend
if i needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park
unbeatable sushi
i dont know why anyone would want to write a great review about this place
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then youll love it here
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 discount on our bill
the big complaint no toasting available
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm
i would just ask for no oil next time
most importantly food is excellent
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual
while i could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us our wonderful server and food made the experience a very positive one
wonderful at holiday time
it cant get any better
the service is awful
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner
the appetizer was interesting but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious
whoever the jazz duo was they were on point
when we sat we got great and fast service
to celebrate a birthday three of us went to mare anticipating great food
the waitress was not attentive at all
give it a try and enjoy
good spreads great beverage selections and bagels really tasty
they seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done my sister still had her fork in hand
great meal the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi this fish was perfect
great atmoshere and worth every bit
my best friend had the chicken shawarma and she still raves about it being the best anywhere
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistencynot too fishy creamy and slightly buttery
it is quite a spectacular scene ill give them that
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else
it was really good pizza
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers
when we threatened to leave we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing
whether its the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite
the buffet had a nice selection
judging from previous posts this used to be a good place but not any longer
good food my favorite is the seafood spaghetti
why is it that almost every good review is by anonymous
and they packaged everything nicely so it didnt spill
if i want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average brunch food then i would put murphys at the top of the list
compared to other shabu restaurants around town this places wins handsdown
i recently tried suan and i thought that it was great
the menu is very limited i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees
at best the food was good and definately overpriced
okayi dont mind the oily part cause most are cooked that way but it was way too bland
best italian food i ever had and being italian that means alot
a large is 20 and toppings are about 3 each
if you can come to this place by boat and make it a whole evening
also very inexpensive
the allucaneat sushi is definitely in very poor quality
i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful
seriously this place kicks ass
the food is good
for authentic thai food look no further than toons
always good
been there lots since and its always a good time
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york
we ate outside at harus sake bar because harus restaurant next door was overflowing
cute place nice wait staff but would never go there again
the dj is awesome i have been there for my birthday and a bunch of other times with friends and i keep going back
ive been to open sesame only once but im still reeling from the experience
i loved this place
the four seasons restaurant is a great experience
i also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of a small restaurant
we all felt it was worth it
delicious crab cakes too
not what i would expect for the price and prestige of this location
i sometimes see the waiters dont have enough knowledge of their dishes
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun dessert recommended by the waiter
we had halfhalf pizza mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for a small size pizza
the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat but planning an event especially a small intimate one forget about it
i went with jwils
great bottle of wine
recommendations of course are required
the place was nice and calm
i am relatively new to the area and tried pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and i thought the food was overated and on the pricey side
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws
average to good thai food but terrible delivery
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city
during our trip to nyc we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pretheater menu offering a modified menu for 65 pp
we left never to return
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese gets a little messy
the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy
best indian food in la
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers
the environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts
service was devine oysters where a sensual as they come and the price cant be beat
the food was well prepared and the service impecable
we had pams special fried fish and it was amazing
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka
mama mia i live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such a great pizza place
i stumbled upon this second floor walkup two fridays ago when i was with two friends in town from la
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that ive had at this price range
someone else recommended the dessert we also left that
the house special roll is really good
will comeback for sure wish they have it here in la
interesting selection good wines service fine fun decor
it was worth the wait
i wasnt thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but i guess thats the price you pay for a popular place
loved it
but that is highly forgivable
but im sure this was just an honest mistake
if youre into being lost when youre just five feet from your table then hey thats a good thing
rather than preparing vegetarian dish the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables minus sauce seasoning or any form or aesthetic presentation
dont be fooled by crowds of people
i will never return again
salads were fantastic
try the chefs choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty
in grammercyunion squareeast village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot
none that i can think of
i felt as though i were eating in paris
the side dishes were passable and i did get a refill upon request
its great if you spent the day there and didnt want to drive to eat
this is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice
ive been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table
when the bill came he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks
whenever you need a sushi fix mizu will be there with quality fish and great service
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together
we got a groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on a thursday night
i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded
i found a new home on second avenue
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place
its a small cute restaurant
the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery creamy which means a big task to diggest tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count pennegot a little moody afterwards cause was stuffedlol
inside is a little cramped but to be expected
had a late night dinner on a saturday night
the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order
yes i ate the food but i certainly would not have if i had seen the maggot before eating and i was at this point fairly sick to my stomach
i would go back
im telling you
id be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely
service was decent
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way i remember them to taste when i was growing up in taiwan
wretched and retching
the place is a bistro which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere
the yellowtail was particularly good as well
the ambiance was a peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney
oh and i never write reviewsi just was so moved by how bad this place was i felt it was my duty to spread the word
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you
this place is always packed
try the pizza ensalata
it is very overpriced and not very tasty
la rosa waltzes in and i think they are doing it the best
some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies like me so if your not a foodie nothing wrong with that head over to mcdonalds or some ruby tuesday and have at it
i will be going back and heartily recommend it
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date
overall not worth the money
i cant saybenough good things about this restaurant and i cant wait for my next several visits
pizza is terrific as is homemade pasta
all in all the food was good a little on the expensive side but fresh
we ate on the outside patio area for dinner on a saturday night
love it every time
always a winner
the setting is casual and romantic
great indian food and the service is incredible
on a recent trip our waiter was extremely dismissive while no less than three staff members waited handandfoot on a pair of japanese girls seated nearby
definitely a neighborhood favorite
nevertheless i finished my plate and thats when i found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom
food was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer so that fat was more of a meltinyourmouth experience
we did tip i guess the modelwaitress just wanted more and complained to the manager
i expected quite a bit more from such an expensive menu
frankly when you compare what you can have here for lunch versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city there is no comparison
i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken
impressed
great hot dogs
i never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending
once we finally got a table despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed
great original taste
i cant say enough about this place
a pleasant surprise
this place is unbelievably overrated
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine which cost less than the food and made it seem like a big concession
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot once you enter the unmarked wooden doors the zen and intimate dcor will make you feel like youre no longer in the city
the large selection of bruschettas paninis tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating
this was a repeat visit and well definitely be back again
i really liked this place
great food great prices great service
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
i would go back for the wine experience alone
finally a meal that you will remember for a long time
i also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee rice porridge
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret
indoor was very cozy and cute
great vibe lots of people
the four seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ive been to the four seasons restaurant
we waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and over 1 12 hours for our food
our server was very professional and friendly
save yourself the waste of time do not visit
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll
the service was excellent friendly and attentive
our waiter was nonexistent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered we were not given any water or utensils
even after they overcharged me the last time i was there
went here last night nice decor good service but the food was surprisingly excellent
we ordered a selection of the small plates and the shoe string onions goat cheese pizza grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good
it doesnt look appetizing as its covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal
it helps if you know what to order
quick and friendly service
try it
the restaurant has a family feel not least with regard to the portions which are enormous the veal alone could have singlehandedly solved third world famine
hey i think 2 for a 5 block walk aint bad
we will be back
there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me
skip nathansyou can get that at the mallgo to bark
i had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of
the food we ordered was excellent although i wouldnt say the margaritas were anything to write home about
great neighborhood joint
ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me
the flavors were good but i have had far better pancakes at a german pancake specialty restaurant that were a little cheaper but significantly larger
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile
they honored reservation on sunday afternoon very well
500 included
also dont plan on asking for your favorite roll if its not on the menu you cant have it
whats the difference between the two
kind attentive wait staff
your a sushi fan you love expertly cut fish great sake a killer soho location and of course salmon tuna fluke yellow tail cod mackeral jellyfish sea urchin shrimp lobster sea bream trout milk fish blue fin tuna eel crab sardine monk fish roe scallop oysters and a varity of toro
absolutely fabulous
im going back
excellent spot for holiday get togethers with coworkers or friends that you havent seen in a while
bagels are ok but be sure not to make any special requests
i highly recommend the fish tacos everything else was ok
the decor is rustic traditional japanese
enough said
this place rocks
the best
you wont be disappointed by their menu
i just dont understand all the hype
its a good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag
i had a grat time at jekyll and hyde
i have a but here there was a bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd
tucked away over by the beverly center
conveniently located too being right on bedford ave
we never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating
waited 35 minutes for a table for 8 which was ok for such a big crowd
the lamb was tender so full of flavor the dessert was divine
dont get me started on the margaritas either
when i got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly
the food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices
what you are paying for is the environment and the name
by far the best pizza in manhattan
you are bound to have a very charming time
i have been eating at this place for over 8 years now and i have never had one bad meal
the pizzas are light and scrumptious
celebrated my fathers birthday here
i highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time
this will be only the third online review i have ever made about a restaurant in my life
the best chuwam mushi i have ever had
a big disappointment all around
i cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant
its definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone
i love margherita pizza i looove east village pizza
this place is so much fun
as a japanese native ive lived in the tristate area for over 8 years but i was just so amazed at this place
parking is reasonably good they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out
people complain about the dim lighting but that is one what i love about this place if you want to stare at your food in bright light go to mcdonalds
poor customer servicepoor pizza
we picked it randomly without a recommendation from someone who has been there so we werent sure what to expect
the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you dont like
youll be ther for every anniversary birthday valentines day
4 locations
i love this restaurant
the music is great no night better or worse the bar tenders are generous with the pouring and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits
the veal was incredible last night
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks and appetizers and walked out
addicting
leave room for dessert
love their pizza especially the mushroom pizza
its the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food
it is nearly impossible to get a table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner do not pass it up
will definitely be back
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the salt encrusted shrimp appetizer
you should pass on the calamari
there are other people waiting
ive lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all
we were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portiona bucket of food literally
so i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach again but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it
should have gone to trader joes and had frozen pizza
there was a small wait but shorter than i expected
i probably wouldnt go back though cuz i dont know if its worth it
the nakgibokum was horrible
i came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband
great place great value
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were
she was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was a few minutes past their opening time
we were charged full price
i have never ever had such an unpleasant experience
i work around the corner and tried it with a colleague for the first time
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but cassuolet steake fritte tripe stew etc simple stuff
amazing food
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must
20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten
small bright and clean bz grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints both in astoria and out
its a tiny place so if you get there before 8pm on a weekend thurssun you will find it easier to get a table or a seat at the sushi bar
i have been to this place folks and it is bad
my mom originally introduced me to this place but even she being indian feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily
if you are going for the food it will not be worth it
service friendly and attentive
its worth the wait especially since theyll give you a call when the table is ready
the wine the service was very good too
this restaurant is vegetarian there are no meat dishes whatsoever
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal
the wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that sheswaycuterthanmethatb way
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great
oh i forgot to mention that they dont have bread service
its great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend
even the wine by the glass was good
good sake good food i honestly dont know much about japanese food at all
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie that dont serve sushi and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city
but nonethelessgreat spot great food
she had heard from a coworker about this place
servers are all different greg is my favorite
dont leave the restaurant without it
i was speechless by the horrible food
snooze provided an inventive pancake offering but le peep would have provided better service and quality
the food was not great the waiters were rude
the design of the space is good
the service ranges from mediocre to offensive
best neighborhood standby
its a nice place to relax and have conversation
my husband and i thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary and to our surprise it was fantastic
best crab cakes in town
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed
the potato balls were not dry at all in fact it was buttery
they have great rolls the triple color and norwegetan rolls are awesome and filling
all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city
food is great and inexpensive
the food is fantastic and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time weve been there
my wife and i went to waters edge for a romantic dinner
i wish they would change back to what it was before
the waiter was attentive the food was delicious and the views of the city were great
delicious
service was prompt friendly and great
the pesto pizza was excellent thincrust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that id never heard of before
what a find
we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast
you would think they would make up for it with service sadly no
the staff was really friendly
mediocre food
big wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach
would not go back
i would normally not finish the brocolli when i order these kinds of food but for the first time every piece was as eventful as the first one the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked
we didnt want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough
moderate prices
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great the food and service could have been a lot better
inexpensive unassuming great time
fabulous decor makes you feel like youre in a trendy manhattan restaurant very very good food cheaplypriced generally friendly staff and if youre a manhattanite or spend most of your time in manhattan rice avenue will make you feel at homevery sohovillageupper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clienteleall on roosevelt avenue
its also attached to angels share which is a cool more romantic bar
it was clear he didnt really care
very pleased
regardless well be back and cant wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio
i picked the grilled black cod as my entree which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better
its cuz its so good you need to taste it
however i think jeckll and hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once
mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even a glass of winebut not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff
in any event this is a place ill be sure to stop by again when im in this part of town
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals
the pad se ew chicken was delicious however the pad thai was far too oily
the food was actually aweful
atmosphere was nice
the view is spectacular and the food is great
indoor ambience was modern
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside
patsys pizza true love
its the perfect spot for a romantic date for 2 or a secret rendezvous
i rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and i was too frustrated to continue
i came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend
the only thing that strikes you is the decornot very pleasant
the food is very averagethe thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet every thing they serve is too sweet here
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinnerthey were replaced by a delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table
the dancing white river and millenium rolls are musts
it is not worth going at all and spend your money there
the food was good
i cannot imagine better indian food in all of the city
this was from start to finish a mindbogglingly uncomfortable experience
what really makes it shine is the food which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices and all made inhouse even the gyro meat and sausages and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected
just go there and see for yourself
they are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey
a great choice at any cost and a great deal
however our 14 drinks were were horrible
you routinely see indian families and friends dining there which is always a good sign
what
stepping into casa la femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in new york
i got hair in my food 2 times of then
we were only in seattle for one night and im so glad we picked rays for dinner
everything was wonderful food drinks staff mileau
i have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over 5 years now and i have never been disappointed
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water
service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category
the pizza is delicious they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzarias
the catering is out of this world and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world
the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded but the service is excellent and its great for friends out a romantic date or a special occassion
i absolutely loved this place
i didnt complain i liked the atmosphere so much
service is fast and friendly
if you are looking for a good quality cheap eats this is the place
6pm on a sat before a broadway play and we were quickly seated and served
we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgibokum
good for late night dining last minute planning without reservations
we started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche
if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants this is not the place for you
schooner or laters charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not unfortunately compensate for its very poor customer service
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake both were delicious
my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent
its just you and your date and an occasional cute excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth
even then the order was not correct and we were still waiting for a couple items
the sushi here is delicious
worst service i ever had
also they serve the best hummus in america with a drizzle of fragrant olive oil which i believe is the traditional way
this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch i wish this review would make a difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for a chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed
keep up the good work
took my mom for mothers day and the maitre d was pretty rude
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are a larger party and it might get crowded
still any quibbles about the bill were offset by the pouryourown measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house
i recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one
much more reasonably priced too
great beer
the fish was reallyreally fresh
we love breakfast food
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes
you can order to go if you have to get back to the office too
the service was quick and friendly
a must try
tasty dog
go beyond the california rolls
the food was authentic
not only is the food
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of selfrespect which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me ie make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water or the check
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice
the service is really attentive and charming
but after last night spice grill is the only place im eating indian cuisine
their bagels are fine but they are a little overcooked and not really a special bagel experience
i have to highly recommend the lobster roll not to much mayo you can tell it was a fresh lobster
yes the place is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while
a cozy spot for 2
so here we are my wife 3 year old daughter and i trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building where the murals and artifacts are
the service was exceptional sometime there was a feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters
next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful
stuffing yourself with japanese food is a rare thing
ahhh
it is so romantic
the food is great and they make a mean bloody mary
it may be a bit packed on weekends but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area
the tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced
went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal
terrible service food ok pricey
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice
every neighborhood has a few great local bars that are the best secrets
i got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright
what more could you want
i took one look at the chicken and i was appalled
i noice most reviews mention the bad service
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon sea bass and crispy duck
after hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant and passing by it on a daily basis we decided to try
the waitstaffs are nice though
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird
and i hate to say this but i doubt ill ever go back
i have been to roths twice and both times were very disappointing
keep up the good work guys
however most of them are at least prompt and pleasant
definitely worth the trip to battery park city
the first time i went and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere i ordered the lobster cobb salad
i found the food service and value exceptional everytime i have been there
i hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix special crab dumplings assorted sashimi sushi and rolls two types of sake and the banana tempura
not only is the cuisine the best around the service has always been attentive and charming
they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends
i picked the asparagus which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared
will not be back
but she is very friendly with certain people making it even more annoying
the crust has a great bite and a good chew the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it the salt from the cheese is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components
the coffe is very good too
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation so a casual lunch here would probably be best
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes
the hostess was very pleasant
also the sandwiches nearing 7 didnt come with anything like chips or a side
however it is jus too good to not praise it
when the main course finally arrived another 45mins half of our order was missing
the nicest waiters in town
to their credit they removed the dish from the check but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was
the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates
run dont walk
the main entree was also very good
right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza
i love essabagel but i live on the west side so i often go to murrays for convenience
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar keep had made only 2 drinks kept telling us shed be right with us
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee oh la la yummy
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs
the food is amazing especially if you get the chefs tasting menu and your favourite bottle or two of wine from an extensive selection of wines
a coworker and i tried pacifico after work a few fridays and loved it
this is some really good inexpensive sushi
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting
food was fine with a some littletastierthannormal salsa
the decor is very simple but comfortable
good music great food speedy service affordable prices
i will definetly be going back
i couldnt even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach
i love sushi and i have eaten it all over the world
food was just averageif they lowered the prices just a bit it would be a bigger draw
i honestly dont even know where to begin
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most
went for moms birthday brunchlunch
i heard the lobster roll was excellent
stick with the chicken beef and lamb dishes
this restaurant was recommended by a localas a matter of fact he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed
went here on sat 126 and was disappointed
this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions
nice job
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can
we shared the family platter and i especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu
there is expensivebutworthit and there is expensiveandwtf
why
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant
wouldnt recomend it for dinner
been there done that and new york its not that big a deal
when my dessert came there was a candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food which was above average but couldnt make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora
dessert is a jokedont bother
furthermore the rice had no seasoning so the sushi was bland and disgusting
too many other good places to have to settle
great food good size menu great service and an unpretensious setting
the wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice good at their jobs and cultured
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance
i ordered the vitello alla marsala and i was pretty impressed
cant argue about that but they are clearly over priced
i hang out and live in the neighborhood
the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wont forget
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful
maitredeat and get out
to be honest we only ever eat the shabu shabu
decent wine at reasonable prices
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money
in the evening this place attracted a well dressed with it ny crowd
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights
i have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused and wasted my hard earned money
you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review
ill keep this short
i was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter
i really loved the different and inovated touch thats the cheff gives to the food
in the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me
the food was average to aboveaverage the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive and the desserts not brilliant in any way
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard
ill be back for sure
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly
6 and there is much tasty food all of it fresh and continually refilled
rice is too dry tuna wasnt so fresh either
this was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater
this place doesnt make any sense
its a great place to people watch
i must give it yon out of yon stars
ive eaten at pizza gruppo a few times but more often i order delivery
the cypriot restaurant has a lot going for it
the atmosphere is great
i felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom
for the price you cannot eat this well in manhattan
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant
service was very prompt but slightly rushed
the fish was fresh though it was cut very thin
the restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
best sushi in town
outside in the area between the restaurant and the park children were running around while their parents sipped wine
furthermore while the fish is unquestionably fresh rolls tend to be inexplicably bland
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions
probably would not go back here
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai
the service is excellent the decor is great and the food is delicious and comes in large portions
compared to essa tal offers a less doughy bagel
great selection of sakes
i have to say i have never had a disapointing meal here
youll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city and most still dont compare
the have a great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for
i have to say that i am pleasantly suprised and i will most likely stop in again if i am in the neighborhood
and amazingly cheap
was there friday night
it was 14 not really bad for a pound of pastramibut it didnt have much tasteive had better for less elsewhere
however one sunday afternoon my husband and i did go although with my loud protests and were pleasantly surprised
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines
the bagels always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens this is among the best
go to volare for 1st class service and terrific food
the freshest best variety and the fastest delivery
the spinach is fresh definately not frozen
this is right up there with places in tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned
logic behind that
its located in greenewich village
the crowd is mixed yuppies young and old
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening
untill this happens my advice is to stay away
single worst restaurant in manhattan
i had yummy lamb korma saag paneer samosas naan etc
their apps are all delicious
the perfect spot
quite simply its like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food i enjoy
raos has the best service and atmosphere in nyc
i came here for my friends birthday and keep coming back ever since
the decor is night thobut they really need to clean that vent in the ceilingits quite unappetizing and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern
the restaurant is cute but not upscale
he served me an uni hand roll which i never had before and let me tell youit was heaven
holy hummus
that was the last night in vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing so we walked in the check the place
the staff offers impeccable service
ok maybe i went in on someones bad day
if only they delivered theyd make a mint
awesome
very poor customer service
the appetizers are also delicious
perfect on a cold day
it was so much though that i could barely finish but i did since it was delicious
i plan on stopping by next week as well
the ambience was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food was really tasty
well this place is so ghetto its not even funny
the filet mignon dish was superb
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry
my husbands was perfect my was well done and dry
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses
finally the homemade donut holes were served for desert
id highly recommend it for a special occasion it provides and intimate setting and nice service
we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different
theyre rude at times and not very friendly
however our main course was wonderful
chintzy portions
how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy or any other for that matter is beyond me
i would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i cant not mention or undermine
given that rays is a seafood restaurantwell you get the idea
overall excellent restaurant
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls
we had fun eating in there we were there like around 3 am in the morning
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip almost 50pp after tax and tip about average
they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant
i am so coming back here again as much as i can
ruth mother of the bride
best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous
its popular wthe late crowd
wow
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting very light and nottoosweet
this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city not just brooklyn
the service was extremely fast and attentivethanks to the service button on your table but i barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order
we ordered the marinated grapes buffalo style chicken wings and the turkey sandwich
with so many great breakfastlunch places in so cal this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit
either that or the editors idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th
if your looking for real quality not the bs that is seen on yelp ratings which allegedly recently got in trouble for adjusting ratings you need to get in here
this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates
well i guess its hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff
thanks blooms for a lovely trip
i pray it stays open forever
but they were too big for the bun
beef noodle soup is good as well
jimmy is dominican
this is one of my favorite spot very relaxing the food is great all the times celebrated my engagement and my wedding here it was very well organized
the onion rings are great
we have been to this place many times and always have great food wine and service
its simply the best meal in nyc
we have since returned and also had a great experience sampling more small plates and a variety of the beer cold and good
the portion sizes here are huge and the sushi is good
ive had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers
a different server enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer which was delicious
i dont usually order wine with indian so i cant comment on their wine list or their wines
ive made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby i live on uws
a brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointmentto say we had been blown off would be an understatement
its unpretentious and underground
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants i have ever seen in nyi am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious
the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service
insultingly overpriced
i loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi 5 big ones to a plate instead of 20 or so little gnocchis and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes
pizza the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings the crust tastes like the best freshly baked bread
nice for one time special occasion
good for dates or with friends
although we were told 1015 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes
but the service is horrid
i can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma
my favorite place lol
you cant go wrong with this place
very immature bartender didnt know how to make specific drinks service was so slowwwww the food was not fresh or warm waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers
every time i have a special occasion with my boyfriend i have a hard time going anywhere else
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites but everything was delicious
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my goto for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future
my friends settled for rice dishes but we came back the following day to try the dim sum which was goodnot outstanding but good
i highly recommend this beautiful place
this was great dining experience
the dishes came out around 5 minutes apart
a guaranteeed delight
the reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews
my boyfriend asked me if i wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead while he deskinned the chicken so that i could enjoy the white meat
over
better than nobu tomoe taka yama sugiyama and the rest
we werent even at our table for more than an hour total
a beef consomme
surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe
dont go with a larger group than 4
i will go back to suan soon
downtown dinner 2002 prixe fix appetizers were ok waiter gave me poor suggestiontry the potato stuff kanish best one
i choose to go with one of the special the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent
this is the best sushi in new york city hands down
the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing
the price is reasonable although the service is poor
i am happy i did the food was awsome
we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes
we had a good time
went to village last night for my birthday
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table
which lets face itat times its a good thing
you will find yourself returning quite often
dont waste money on decor
the food they serve is not comforting not appetizing and uncooked
will absolutely visit again
finally a reliable chinese restaurant
this place is a great bargain
this dish is my favorite and i always get it when i go there and never get tired of it
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go
the food is great and the environment is even better
once youre inside the real experience begins
skip this location and go to the one in soho
its just average just shredded no seasoning on it
we go often for lunch and the place is packed
rays is something of a seattle institution but given its gorgeous sound views i had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service
in about 12 minutes the thing is gone
the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate
my only negative comment is that i wish the pieces were a little bigger
the food arrived in about 15 minutes
taking hot dogs to the next level
i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two
the asparagus truffle oil parmesan bruschetta is a winner
her review is above
the atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate
first of all i am not from long beach
not the biggest portions but adequate
price no more than a jersey deli but way better
great open and friendly ambience
to start things off our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order
to me it exemplifies soho cute artsy interesting
the mussles were the fishiest things ive ever tasted the seabass was bland the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese the penne w chicken had bones in it it was disgusting
i was one of the people that went for this horrible experience
i dont get it either
i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced
the wait here is long for dim sum but if you dont like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig this is a sleek for chinatown alternative
my girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant
the level of rudeness was preposterous
but if youre prepared to spend some and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the place to go for indian food
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent
everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome
the service varys from day to day sometimes theyre very nice and sometimes not
um so now what are appetizers for
there were 3 bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink
brunch at murphys is to die for my specialty egg white omelet the food is always freshly prepared
the worst excuse for japanese food ive ever encountered
late night dinning with exeptional food
the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive
thalia is a beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you but the food doesnt quite match up
we put in our order and although we ordered 4 appetizers the food didnt arrive until 45 minutes laterwith our main course
rao is a good restaurant but its nothing special
im a friendly person so i wouldnt mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal
when youre sitting in their main dining room which has a spectacular handpainted high ceiling youd never know there was a world outside
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited
the service was attentive
nice value
old reliable
the lobster sandwich is 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price
i live in the neightborhood and am a regular
the food is great
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh a delicious and sweet tasting bread
im sure ill return for a final judgement tho
we will return many times for this oasis in midtown
lucky strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat
the food was great the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me
drawbacks service is slow and they dont toast
the counter service is bad
the turkey burgers are scary
authentic taiwanese food thats cheap what more could you ask for
the music playing was very hip 2030 something pop music but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat which became annoying midway through dinner
simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices
good food great service average prices for the strip
i was wrong
raymond the bartender rocks
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean
they dont concern much of customers health just want to make money
great toppings definitely a place you need to check out for late night munchies or a mid day boost
dont dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes they are simply not up to par with the nonveg selections
will never be back
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening
great friendly service fast seating fast delivery excellent sushi
an excellent service
i waited for 1015 minutes for service ordered a beer was never served again
and you cant beat the prices
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself a favor and check this place out
everything was going good until we got our meals
most importantly we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu
it was horrible
starters kobe beef sashimi
i love the warm cosy environment
just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll
sometimes i get good food and ok service
sit outside in the warm weather inside for cozy winter
helpful service and average price per dish 10
the atmosphere is unheralded the service impecible and the food magnificant
the food was not fresh the sauces were bland and very oily
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months
love the food
lobster was good nothing spectacular
the food is reliable and the price is moderate
indo chinese food pretty good
yes it is good but ive had better for cheaper
the pizzas are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings
went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them
avoid this place
everyone raved about the atmosphere elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views and the fabulous food
never swaying never a bad meal never bad service
his response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening
my family ate here last weekend
it wasnt the freshest seafood ever but the taste and presentation was ok
i ended the meal with the unusual dessert of a port and chocolate tastingyummy
i go here at least once every other week particularly when its cold
on weekends you might have to wait for couple hours
as of writing this i just tried their give away a link again it still doesnt work
i just read mocaramels review and felt compelled to respond
the food was excellent as well as service however i left the four seasons very dissappointed
the wine list is excellent
will give it another chance before i write it off
poor service and management
im partial to the gnocchi
this place is always very crowded and popular
the brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal
the pizza is overpriced and soggy
i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night
i am so happy to have a wonderful italian restaurant in my neighborhood
warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu
their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for
i tried a couple other dishes but wasnt too impressed
a gentleman maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order
we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial
this restaurant was way overhyped
they all know you
i am never disappointed with there food
decor is charming
it reminds me of those great little restaurants in san francisco
it was totally overpriced fish and chips was about 15
its a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but weve eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years
the svc can be a bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is a must
the service leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night
i absolutely love this place
after passing by this restaurant for sometime i finally decided to go in and have dinner
even though the place is not beautiful the food speaks for itself
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed
if celebrities make you sweat then your in for a ride but if your like most around these parts then youll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations
we werent
not enough wines by the glass either
small servings for main entree i had salmon wasnt impressed girlfriend had chicken it was good
the service is fantastic at this fun place
there was a really nice vibe about the placegood music atmosphere and happy looking people
he offers subpar service and has no personality
i highly recommend it
not only have i worked in restaurants for many years i am now in culinary school i am a huge lover of oysters and fish and my girlfriend is half korean
her sister had the baklava for dessert
i love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it
big thick pepperoni
the pizza was great
this is such a lovely peaceful place to eat outside
i have never been disappointed in the red eye
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well
excellent sashimi and the millennium roll is beyond delicious
a perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year
the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it
it was absolutely amazing
fresh restaurant was amazing food was delicious and of course fresh
the antipasta was excellent especially the calamari as were the filling pasta mains
worth the trip from manhattan
this establishment is the real deal
i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded
have gone to all the top places
priced at upper intermediate range
ravioli was goodbut i have to say that i found everything a bit overpriced
my wife and i visited dokebi tonight
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order
if you want to dine with large party i recommend to make reservation basement
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said can i help you and how many are in your party
i do not think dinner in manhattan should cost 40000 where i am not swept off my feet
i went there 2times
this was 2 times what the same meal would have cost at le peep
that place was awesome sally
it wasnt as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand but now its simply repulsive
the place is beautiful
fish is so very fresh
splendid
i am going to the mid town location next
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs
downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
please be aware that its cash or amex only
we ordered our appetizers i ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon
the owner truly caters to all your needs
i had filet mignon with garlic mash
essabagel either by stytown or midtown is by far the best bagel in ny
had many dishes but the best was the lobster 3 ways
this place which is only a few months old is perhaps queens biggest secret
my daughters wedding reception at waters edge received the highest compliments from our guests
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wont notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 frickin hours to come
the appetizing is excellent just as good as zabars barney greengrass at a reasonable price if bought by the pound
we have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given
our friends have not arrived yet
the best dish are the honwy walnut prawns just outstanding
try the pad thai its fabulous and their prices are so cheap
ambience is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation
melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi and very tasty rolls too
every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street
a sushifiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner
they serve it in a tall skinny hourglass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket
they have authentic indian at amazin prices
we all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york
this place is the most japanese it can ever get
very cozy and warm inside
i have to agree with the previous reviewer
absolutely delicious
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd
the food was great
it was romantic and even nice even with my sister reminded me of italy and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in a mediterrean villa
great bagels made the oldfashioned way
as a retired hipster i can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laidback late night in the city
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser
i took my parents here for their anniversaryvery very disappointed
the 2 listed and then one in southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in ft collins
if its nice outside request for a table in the balcony
the bread was stale the salad was overpriced and empty
have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience
the sushi is amazing
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city
my six year old loved it
the frizzy retro girl with winged dame edna glasses will yell at you if you try to order a drink
i loved everythig about itespecially the shows and actors
the food is decent at best and the ambience well its a matter of opinion some may consider it to be a sweet thing i thought it was just annoying
one of the best sushi place in town
this place is worth an onehour drive
no desert menu no apology nothing
red dragon roll my favorite thing to eat of any food group hands down
most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like that couple
just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday
the food here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it
if i could give 0 stars i would do so for this place
i went home looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that doesnt work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service deceptive link
try the crunchy tuna it is to die for
you cannot go wrong with this place
the cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes
it is sad to see a place that was once the place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch now be the place that is a big dont bother
believe us weve been eating sushi for over 15 yrs
rays is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners
lives up to the hype
the service was attentive yet discreet
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter so im looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it
this staff should be fired
their specialty rolls are impressive though i cant remember what we had
not sure if i would go back
i thought this place was totally overrated
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge
so close but not good enough
i was pleasantly suprised
the quantity is also very good you will come out satisfied
cant wait to go back
i took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night
the prior reviews said kid friendly give me a break with two young children that is light years
the kitchen however is almost always slow
once for dinner and once for brunch
decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing
you cant go wrong here
you can do it here
green tea creme brulee gets better each time i have it
truly the mark of an attentive waiter
everything we had was good or okbut definitely nothing great
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone
well i didnt find it there and trust i have told everyone i can think of about my experience
plan on waiting 3070 minutes
thank you
as usual the omikase didnt disappoint in freshness although it scored low on creativity and selection
i cant believe people complain about no cheese sticks
for those that go once and dont enjoy it all i can say is that they just dont get it
and all you other people that have a problem get some help
the food is amazing rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza
the decor was beautiful and unique
amazing
was surprisingly disappointed
authentic shanghai style and i cannot recommend a better shanghai place in new york
bad staff
coming from boston this place is like emmas pizza in kendall square in cambridge although they have more funky toppings
no plans to return anytime soon
the pizza was pretty good and huge
no thanks
not one of our meals was edible bland andor made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring
i cant remember the last time i had such gross food in new york
i had the kafta plate and it was perfect
winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you
i wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly curiousity got the best of me and i paid dearly for it
kudos to these guys
i will be out with friends and all of a sudden i am hungry and i only crave one thing their pizza
however this place is a gem and i wont stop going back
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking a stabilized it for me
i have eaten at saul many times the food is always consistently outrageously good
i went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was a blast
service was good and food is wonderful
faan is sooo good
the space kind of feels like an alice in wonderland setting without it trying to be that
i live in the west village and ive been to a lot of restaurants
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo
i have never had cheescake like this
if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table
volare virgins or weekly regulars everyone gets treated the same and you cant ask for more than that when the service is this friendly
wellthey can run but they cant hide
so good
great service great food
went there last night with a friend
go hungry and enjoy
the food is simply unforgettable
excellent food although the interior could use some help
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews
the martinis are amazing and very fairly priced
great sake
all in all the food was great except for the dessserts
they were served warm and had a soft fluffy interior
this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money
the veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly
our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce
then to top things off she dropped used silverware on my boyfriends jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes
i was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have
fabulous food if the front of house staff dont put you off
there are so many better places to visit
once seated it took about 30 minutes to finally get the meal
for a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service
space was limited but the food made up for it
mmm good
i cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there
best in all of nyc
maybe tomorrow
nothing on the menu is less than amazing
in the end you end up with a fair tab and nothing but a great time
were going back d
and the service was simply spendid quite a delight
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll
we had lava cake we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 12 to make it
should checkup on us more frequently dont you think
if you dont like it i dont know what to tell you
go to japanese sushi place or spanish tapas place this creation in williamsburg is a misstake
cirspy crust margherita pizza
my friend is 100 right in the experience we had
great find in the west village
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it
as with most restaurants in seattle miopostos service was bad and the food was overpriced
the wine list is interesting and has many good values
good eats
drinks are suberb and i feel like i am in a third world country when i walk in the door
rude service medicore foodthere are tons of restaurants in nystay away from this one
best food phenominal service
went to cafe spice with 4 of my friends on a saturday night
the atmosphere is nothing special but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo
went on a monday night so there was no wait for a table
we recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating perfect since i had my yorkie with me
id definitely go back again
decor is nice though service can be spotty
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night but i did remain puzzled by one issue who thinks that rays is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner
wed go back again
everything i had was good and im a eater
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up
the sake menu should not be overlooked
she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food
with so many good restaurants on the uws i dont need overpriced food absurdly arrogant waitstaff who dont recognize they work at a glorified diner clumsy service and management that doesnt care
the bestt
the food is excellent
i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try
mizu is the japenese find in grammercy
i am bringing my whole family back next time
a classic
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded
they forgot a sandwich didnt include plastic forks and didnt include pita with the hummus platter
i am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience
they are not greasy or anything
perhaps now scooner or later falls into the dive category
id hate for tourists to go to park chalet and think that this is how all san francisco restaurants are like
i generally like this place
this place survives on reputation alone
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else
just ignore the trendy wannabes
very very nice
short and sweet seating is greatits romanticcozy and private
prices are in line
i will be going back very soon
i was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda
much more than just a great view
i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood
we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant
as a student in nyu i need a place to eat after a hard day of work so usually i just go to any indian restraunt near by
the presentation of the food was an added bonus it looked just as great as it tasted
cute and decorative
i took one bite from the 24 salmon and i have never in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in flatbush farms
the food is flavorful plentiful and reasonably priced
but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly
the hostess was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us
the menu has so many fish items and oysters
great value sushi with high quality nice setting
the specialty here is decadent pancakes but ive been back now four times and ive been wowed every time
but the pizza is way to expensive
drinks way over priced
i can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place
but that wasnt the icing on the cake a tiramisu that resembled nothing i have ever had
my gf and i both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary
love the atmosphere felt like i was in paris
overpriced and not tasty
no comparison
for a fabulous wedding
finally my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked are you waiting for a table
i cannot wait to go back again this coming weekend
great seasonal fish and seafood with a classy waterfront setting
took forever to get our order taken water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention
waitstaff are very friendly
love their drink menu
have eaten at ginger house several times and its always good
good drink
nice view of river and nyc
what a great place
delicious bagels especially when right out of the oven
i will not go back
we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh
my service was stellar
very disappointed
the pizza was slightly reminescent of bakers beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago a distant second
its a great little place with tons of potential to be a neighborhood joint if the service werent so impersonal and corporatelike
guacamoleshrimp appetizer was really great we both had the filet very good didnt much like the frites that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared
on our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table
seating is always prompt though the restaurant does fill up in the evening
terrible terrible management deserves to be shutdown
30 minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off
fine dining restaurant quality
if you ware looking for korean fusion i suggest you try some of the places in the east village
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable makes students go back to suan again and again
the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it
my husband said he couldve eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had
well worth it
the 9 oz steak came next and it tasted great at least initially
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city
but who says murrays is anything about service
the bagel was huge
nice ambience but highly overrated place
id go back there in a heartbeat
food is usually very good though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build
i went to areo on a sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends and spent three enjoyable hours there
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is 25 which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place doesnt have an upscale feel
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth
my husband and i love eating at mioposto caf
the service was attentive yet unimposing the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced
one of the best hot dogs i have ever eaten
an awesome organic dog and a conscious eco friendly establishment
the decor in this place is very dinerish and the kind of place you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse
i recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on 2nd street and wow what a great evening we had
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic
food is excellent
i had the thai style fried sea basswhich was very good
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert
when i walked in i was taken aback by their incredible wood decor
go with some friends wait the half hour or so with a cup of joe and enjoy more than your average breakfast
the food is always fresh
i love breakfast here
i cant wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio
people are always friendly
service however was excellentand i liked the settingatmosphere a lot
for me dishes a little oily but overall dining experience good
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible
the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared
i complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted
never got an explanation as to what was going on
mercedes restaurant is so tasty the service is undeniably awesome
creative consistent fresh
and even with its pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too
great breakfast
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded
it was wonderful
cry me a river stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food
the high prices youre going to pay is for the view not for the food
not much of a selection of bottled beer either we went with brahma
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained this is a great place to go and eat
in the end our check came to 27 for 4 small pancakes a breakfast burrito an orange juice and an iced tea i had water
the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough both in quantity and quality
i like the somosas chai and the chole but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing
a restaurant that doesnt try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere
a little overpriced but worth it once you take a bite
baluchis has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices
very disappointing
who has room for cheesesticks with the best pizza in nyc
wasnt going to share but i feel obligatedwhile sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing
also love their caeser salad
you are with a hot date and heshe has an urge for sushithen this might be the place
over all it was a very nice romantic place
for 7 years they have put out the most tasty most delicious food and kept it that way
i went there after hearing how great it was
this was a great surprise
as bfc doesnt take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated which can be over an hour later
have frequented ino for several years and the food remains excellent
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese
a little noise but i think that was because of our party
i highly recommend mioposto
the chips and salsa are so yummy and the prices are fabulous
they have 4 locations
not bad
maggot in the food
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends having lunch dinner pretheatre or aftertheatre drinks
not chewy at all
me and my girls will definitely go back
