pretty much every major game save for solitare wont even play on it due to the slower processor
unimpressed
i love my macbook pro
the online customer service was awful
i put off buying a mac for years
after not having a disc player i have actually noticed that i never used this disc play in my old laptop either
the headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone
in all my life i have never come across a computer as slow as this one it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless
i have been a mac user since the mid 90s
in fact i am completely frustrated
its very fast and very light
not the day received
granted its still a very new laptop but in comparison to my previous laptops and desktops my mac boots up noticeably quicker
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me
my husband got me this for chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days
but theres this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os x like windows
and he saidquot this computer does not have a disk drive and i was furious
awesome graphics
its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great aside from its quality design and sexy looks
i couldnt even install linux on it
i can appreciate why she recommended it
the lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months
just to be clear
the keyboard and sound are great and the matte screen works well
oh boy
this is a great home computer
although it was slow but i felt it was ok for the price you have bought it
then there was a power cord recallhp never notified usand we did registernever again
i even ran it as administrator still no effect
those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall
the battery life is amazing the versitility is outstanding
no more apple devices in my household
still getting used to typing on it my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where i was typing
i use a cooling pad but it doesnt help
very fast boot up and shut down
im going back to pc
the extended warranty for the 4000 and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu
suffice it to say my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed
who uses one these days
this is really nice but i hate the awkward right mouse clicking sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt may be the laptop may be the laptop in conjunction with windows 8
the 1 reason that is always repeated
the screen is a little glary and i hated the clicking buttons but i got used to them
i looked around and based off my pricefeatures comparison from a brand i trusted i landed here
awesome laptop i love it
tiny forgivable drawback no ethernet cable outlet
i appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing dell but just not worth it
anyways i bought this two months ago and when i first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone
being a pc user my whole life
i absolutely love my mac
this computer i used daily nice compact design
sad very sad
its not bad just very very annoying
good speakers from laptop computer
so to communicate i need to wear ear plugs or a headset with a builtin mike
i fine apple mc373lla 266ghz 15 macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for a laptop computer when on the go
with in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down
the macbook is a fantastic laptop
its light fast and has great battery
but what should i expect from a unit that is this thin and this light
im very happy with this machine
finally i should note that i took the 2gb ram stick from my old eeepc and installed it before i even powered on for the first time
if you have any creativity in you do yourself a favor and get a mac
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase
i am very happy with this laptop
went silently
i find it much easier to type on and much more durable
a great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing a keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for a document
the computer of the people
all for such a great price
its definitely not worth the money
i get about 5 or so hours playing the sims
i hate the display screen and i have done everything i could do the change it
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too
sdhc card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs
4 laptop still did not work blue screen within a week
only drawback is no led to show when the hard drive is being accessed
the processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went
however i always recommend at least 8 gigs so i ordered 8 gigs from amazon
it also does not have bluetooth
this computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online lifebanling facebook etc and some basic offline work using ms office
even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design
without a big ol clunky machine in my backpack i feel like i can do programming homework anywhere
this machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem
i play a lot of casual games online and the touchpad is very responsive
apparently there is a manufacturing defect something with the amount of thermal paste
they said it was a computer error on this type of computer
it allows me to do everything i need from a computer and more
highly recommend for daily use
good battery life
i grew up in a design family so it only made sense
if you want ease of use and longterm happiness buy a macbook
and i babyed the heck out of it just one day when i opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke
the plastic materials are rather cheap
this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks and i am impressed with the intuition of the design the beauty of the product and the excellent technological advances associated with it
it is a bit heavy
good price
at 16 months it started shutting off after only 5 or 10 minutes
i would not hesitate recommending this to anyone
if that changes i will add an update to this
3 remember its a dual core
external monitor worked easily
its very sturdy
couldnt keep a page up you were working on
this is a great machine
only thing i dislike is that everything for mac is expensive but i guess you pay for quality
runs fast the touch screen hasnt lost any sensitivity im overall very happy with it
so if anyones looking to buy a computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it
dell is a decently made pc
the retina display is fantastic
if you need an affordable entrylevel laptop this will fit the bill
i needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine
i was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop
first off amazing laptop
the laptop refuses to start we have troubleshooted all areas still fails to start
this laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the 5th generation intel core which draws less power thus less heat
also it is very good for college students who just need a reliable easy to use computer
touchscreen is great
ive only had this for a week overall i like the computer its thin amp light and the wireless keyboard works great
i am really sorry i bought this machine
avoid acer
it even has a great webcam and skype works very well
i was surprised at the overall quality and the price
it has everything i would need for a home computer
i got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it
i recommend for word processing and internet users
it still did not pair
i bought this laptop about a month ago to replace my compaq laptop
now i have dual booted my laptop to windows 81 and ubuntu 1404 and its not got too slow either
its a pleasure to type on
well not really well
it was also cheaper than the pro which made it even more appealing to me
ill wait and save up for a new one
i bought this lap top and the charge time dosent last as long as they say it will more like 2 hours
it works
i am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time
they didnt say yes and they didnt say no they just pretended that i never asked it which was incredibly frustrating
i bought a protector for my key pad and it works great
if you had pc for four years i can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer
i gave it to him
my daughter has had her macbook pro longer than i have she goes on every social network possible and has not had one problem
thats how frustrating it was
i tried to upgrade it to a newer version a couple of months ago and i still have the same problem
other ports include firewire 800 gigabit ethernet magsafe port microphone jack
i should have been more observant
so i would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
keyboard is nice and windows 81 is great worried about that coming from xp
it seems to be incompatible with everything else
the computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch
i use that alot on my desktop so i am adjusting to not having it
my laptop is almost 2yrs old and i have never had any problems with it
the keyboard is a little wonky with having to use the function button to get the fkeys but with how infrequently i use those it is a nonissue
overall the high price of the macbook pro may convince users to buy a cheaper windows pc instead
it gives me the power and speed that i need to run all the programs i use to edit
im no power user but i have had no learning curve with the mac and i dont do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os
received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed
also if after reading some reviews and doing some research i found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus
i think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive but i rather have a hard copy
power supply went bad after 2 weeks
the price was good
i was impressed sony puts in small touches like a usb charging port on the charger
never again
amazing quality
the laptop is gorgeous
well my first impressions are that its ok it certainly boots up quickly thanks ssd and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage
i could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage
right size and weight for portability
does a great job with video shot on a canon 5d mkii
its great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them
i will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how i was treated by the company
i cant put a protector to make presentation
the macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance
this is my first apple computer and i couldnt be more pleased
this mac is great
it has times were it freezes for 10 seconds and then starts again
1great display
i had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair
computer runs very slow
would definitely recommend for those who are technologically ignorant
i go to purchase it on line and i find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later
all in all i am very happy with this purchase
im warning you youre wasting your money on this
he uses to play mine craft and school work
otherwise all other features are a 1
2 8 gig ram needed if you are as productive as i am dj photography movie making etc its quick
the i7 is incredibly fast the ram makes it proper for several games not on maximum quality
bigger hd better graphics card and a bid hd
the 4 usb ports are nice but the two on the side only work now and then
you may need to special order a bag
buy it love it and i promise you wont regret it
i returned my windows 8 and went for the apple and i am glad i did
i have had this laptop for a few months now and i would say im pretty satisfied
its a very basic laptop
its not touchscreen
no hdmi port
i came from a dell inspiron i also paid about 1000 for it
the battery life has increased from the last version from 4 hours to 7 hours making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing a charger
i know what 7 hrs of battery looks like
the right speaker did not work
i gave this product 5 stars because i have been looking for a macbook pro for a long time and i found it here for a wonderful price
just for simple web browsing and media streaming
the os is also very user friendly even for those that switch from a pc with a little practice you can take full advantage of this os
this is my second laptopand it is head and shoulders above my first
functions well
im glad that it has such great features in it
do not use the facial recognition
standard issue for company roadwarriors where i work
i also found the track pad irritating until i disabled quotpinch zoomquot
i am pleased with my decision however i have only had this for a few weeks
overall the screen resolution though nonretina is sufficient for normal web browsing and work
very frustrating
speakers dont get that loud but good enough
when prompted enter your code printed on the back of your cd sleeve to unlock the full potential of microsoft office 2011 for mac
its color is even cool
the screen is good the whole things is very light and doesnt run hot
make sure you follow the directions on the updates i followed the directions and didnt have any problems
havent quite figured out how to make the font size larger overall
i work in film editing and post production so i need a laptop that not only has power but memory and speed as well
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling
it takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works
for a noncomputer savvy person it was very disappointing
this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair
at my age i need this kind of laptop
computer seemed sluggish for an intel core i5 device
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part
good monitor and performed well
the notebook pctoshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me
ill leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself and just conclude by saying that im delighted with my purchase
this was recommended to me by an it support specialist in the local school district
the speed is fine
but other than that i am blown away by all the features this laptop offers
i love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like a tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things
upon giving them the serial number the first thing i was told was that it was out of warranty and i could pay to have it repaired even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty
it is quiet and a real joy to watch work
everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point
we returned two days later
a mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value
ive had this laptop for about a month now
windows operating system is a superior product by far
mobas like dota 2 and smite can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more
as a long time pc user i nearly done using pcs
this is the best switch i have ever done
really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints
its fast and has excellent battery life
i would like to tell you about the best laptop i just got from mac
sometimes it stops receiving wifi signal so i have to restart it
the screen is bright and clear the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice
i upgraded the memory from 4gb to 8gb and found the user manual which i read while awaiting the laptop to arrive more useful than the youtube demo
the macbook pro has a significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes
the display on this computer is the best ive seen in a very long time the battery life is very long and very convienent
its also worth noting that there no bluetooth no mircophone jack no ethernet no dvdcd driveburner and no usb 30 ports
the touch pad feel is a 4 on scale 1 10
i was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10 but it is pretty awesome
this one doesnt do that
the dvd burner broke after burning 3 dvdd during that time
needs longer lasting battery more than 1 to 2 hrs
can be used for gaming as well
i know its not my internet connection because i have an hp as well and its like lightening even with the mass of data and info i have on it
i would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use stylish fun awesome computer
im making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way and apple does indeed have the better idea
ease of use is just one of the benefits i love about my mac
i upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows 7 starter to win 7 home and it runs just fine
today it hasnt worked at all more than it has
this one has had the same effect
if you want more information on macs i suggest going to applecom and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications
additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshibaspecific software that may or may not be to a users liking
im a small business owner and a productivity aspect is very important to me
im so disappointed
the magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool
10 plus hours of battery
i would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their ios products though there are cheaper options any new computer users as it is easy to learn and anyone who needs to be efficient as the gestures make it very easy to multitask
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely
i have owned it only two months
purchased as a gift for a friend
im very impressed
other installed features such as certain printer software are also most attractive
runs hot
very pleased so far
the laptop is very lightweight can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight
since i keyboard over 100 wpm i look for a unit that has a comfortble keyboard no keys sticking or lagging strange configuration of extra key etc
i could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so i went to the apple store myself and asked for a manager
if youre not wanting to be mobile this is a good laptop to sit on a desk
expensive but worth it
the i3 processor doesnt seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on
other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long im pretty happy with the computer
love the price too
still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work
strengthswellshaped
i would never go back any more i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible
3 i didnt wanted a 4k or a touch display for laptop
im very happy with it typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that
gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile
im a designer turned frontend developer and this computer is unusable for frontend development
of course it dies 3 days past the return window
its sad because their commercials are great
in 5 months the connect quality got worse and worse
its got a very slow process keys dont respond fast as macbooks
both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them
the seller was great and i had my computer within 2 days
the backlit keyboard is a nice touch especially
this computer is good for anything and it has really superseded my high expectations
the processor and gpu are fantastic at running games and multiple apps
but like i said before the only reason i dont currently have a mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey
this product was doa
you can also buy one of apples magic mice which connect to your mac using bluetooth and also allows you to use certain multitouch gestures such as zoom and scroll
overall i love it
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started
dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes
the battery seems adequate for most uses 45 hour usecharge
after a couple of years my battery life began to diminish but was replaced for free due to a companywide recall of my particular battery
built in mike is really poor and unusable for skype or any other purpose
allinall i would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone
the computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems
it is not ideal for children because of the temp
it is always reliable never bugged and responds well
i still have weird freezing problems with it and its pretty slow but its not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in
highly recommended
it was over rated
super laptop
amazon has since fixed the price to show the same but it is now higher on both platforms but price is the same now
i did have to replace the battery once but that was only a couple months ago and its been working perfect ever since
we dont mind and you dont matter
the book is useless
using this machine is like a mild form of torture
sturdy but only for typical wear and tear
the old unibody macbook pro could fry an egg after a while
still getting use to window 8
i am not satisfied with the product
i am also upset with cr for giving a good rating
the only thing i didnt learn in my research was the software i would need like privacy protection and warranty protection in case it gets broken or crashes etc
i find myself using the 10key more than i thought i would
although my model was listed as recalled hp denied my claim
they will contact you
i just recently had to ship my laptop back to hp for repair
its actually very obvious
i get giddy every time i use this thing
they say sorry out of warranty
they also have a longer service life than other computers i have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks
as i live in brazil i dont know if is there any local guarantee for my computer
the ati graphics card is a huge plus definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a intel builtin card would have trouble with such as halflife 2 or even world of warcraft
its also very capable of doing moderate video editing although you may need the performance boost of the larger macbook pros for heavy duty mobile video editing
there are a few things i am dissappointed with though
this comes in very handy for me as an educator
one of the best thing i have bought in years
this is my second macbook
i would shop around for a better one
the only thing i wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16 laptop does
if it had a 45 star option that is what i would give
most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad
it super shiny so you can see the fingerprints easily
while lacking some of the functions of the other versions this was very acceptable for the uses planned for this computer
wonderful super fast lightweight computer
im very happy with this computer
not blazing fast but quick enough
when you open it wakes up almost immediately
i have had the netbook for 2 months and i love it i read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers i use
everything is falling apart internally and externally
yes i have it on the highest available setting
each time taking about 1 day or so
but i am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it
first things first macbook pro has many applications to make life easier unlike the windows computers
this is my first personal satellite purchase but had very good experience through previous satellite work issued laptops
i have had it for almost four years now and i have only had a few problems with it
its graphics arent bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website
3 no anti spyware needed never had a virus and i never will
this system came loaded with windows 7 starter
all you have to do is turn it on and it works
the speed is incredible and i am more than satisfied
this computer gets very hot before shutting down
no i am generous calling it slow
oh and it has word and stuff but its a trial verion so after about a month or so when you go to open it it asks for a product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all i use the old word processer which works good
but hey its an apple
the battery life is good even with using high profile software like sibelius 7 for a good half of the day
i would not recommend this product to anyone
typically when i purchase a new laptop i always end up using an external mouse for convenience
the os takes some getting used to especially after being a windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it
i like it better than my big dell laptop
i also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen
the genius at the apple store advised me that there was nothing about my use of the computer that caused this failure
it didnt take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation its been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better
oops
most windows laptops have at least 1
start up time took forever everything runs very slowly
the battery lasted 12 months then pffftgone
i enjoy very much my new toshiba purchased specifially for attending online schooling
ive owned this labtop for less then two months already the mouse button has broke
i have had it over a month now and it works just fine
it is hard to fix and makes it a hassle to own one
its not what you pay for
its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs
high price tag however
it is light and the battery last a very long time
i wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only a month
love that it doesnt take up space like a regular computer
she said its very user friendly
if the number of patrons in the apple store are any indication hp and other pc manufacturers need to take note
when i finally had everything running with all my software installed i plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed
i was happy with my purchase of a toshiba satellite l305ds5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty
i barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load
finally i couldnt take it anymore and ordered my apple
ive owned other models as well
start up is fine maybe 20 secs at most but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times
ive had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful english speaking from vancouver techs that walked me through the processes to help me
4 sound is great
i highly recommend that you buy this product
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm
it has 256gb ssd which is just enough for my os games documents and anything in between
more times that not the screen pops up saying i have a bad internet connection or the page cant be displayed
the touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi fast
in my line of work i often have to take work home and this makes it so easy
the resolution is even higher then any other laptop on the market
if the price doesnt deter you youll find it well worth it in terms of troublefree operation
i have a 250 gb ssd and 10 gb of ram in it which i installed myself
my second mac
not impressed with macintosh products
while i have only ever owned hp laptops i made sure to look into other brands including asus dell and microsoft
delivery was early too
thank you asusthey dont deserve to be capitalized
the computer it self is amazing
great price and computer
if youre the type of person that just likes to browse the internet and enjoy media and do light work with microsoft office this is the laptop for you
vista is a nightmare
dont buy this model
i was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain flash
i have recommended this laptop to everyone i know who is buying one
the performance will improve on it
b a dvdcd player
excellent keyboard and crisp screen
i purchased this netbook after my original toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired
once i complete a jewelry piece taking photos and keeping track of sales
my final thoughts if you are a mac user stay away
my last computer a toshiba cost only 400 and worked like a charm for many years
i needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria
it is however very heavy
it could be lighter but couldnt everything
would not buy it again
whats fast enough
4loud fan when watching 4k video off youtube
navigation through the computer is far superior compared to windows operating systems as well
didnt work when shipped from walmartcom but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop same makemodel
like the price and operation
can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with a great display
it runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems
if it was possible to give them 0 start i would have done it
it has easy to use features and all the speed and power i could ask for
bought a spare one for college and one for my mom d
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were
they sent me a replacement part and without informing me are requiring that i return it within 15 days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later
this is a great laptop and i would recommend it to anyone
i like that
i use iphoto all the time which is a great program for anyone who is into photography amateurs and experts alike
i have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing
i made a perfect decision when i bought the toshiba
it discharges too quickly
so this was great for me
battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display
used my ir remote with it and was kinda glad i didnt buy the retina display or the air
ps a friend who knows a great deal about computers started with windows then he bought a mac mini
i am sure it will be able to do all i need it to do in the future as well
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from a pc
also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after 8 months the screen split in half just from everyday use
i wanted to be able to add my own memory add a second hard drive and in the future replace the battery when it begins to fail
i used to be a windows user but now prefer os x
the thing that you insert cds into wont open
very great apple product as expected
weaknessesa bad videocard
the apple macbook is the best investment that i have ever made
the price was very good and the product is top quality
i would strongly recommend to remove it and install windows 7 on it with a usb drive
thats a nuisance for family skype callsonly one can speak at a time
this is my first macbook coming from a windows environment
for 250 i highly recommend
when you click and dont wait
its comfortable to have it on my lap because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptops body and not accumulated on the screen like most amp34hybridamp34 ones do
visibility the screen has brightness settings that can be changed to fit different peoples needs also the retina display is available for an extra cost if students need a higher quality of display
my mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary
basic computer
the new operating system called snow leopard is installed and ready for use
i received a dud and have had nothing but problems since right after i purchased this horrible machine
the only downfall is a lot of the software i have wont work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it
the pc is works well with a good battery and a power cable and has a web cam
you cant get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive
3 horrible customer supportthey lost my laptop for a monthgot it back 3 months later
i love everything about it
its still beautiful and has better color reproduction than i could ever expect from a notebook
with all the goodies inside this machine it is a value
i had upgraded my old macbook to lion so i kind of knew what i was getting but hadnt been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multitouch features
i wonder if thats just apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop 34 years from now lol
those looking to drop 1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker macbook air
initially i liked the product so much
all i needed this for was to do some typing and simple internet browsing and maybe watching netflix here and there
my daughters macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago
in addition all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations
it is easy to use has great screen quality and every so light weight
what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side apples osx mountain lion the sleek looks apple always delivers reasonable specs good battery life nice keyboard and excellent trackpad
i have had some excellent computer and have found i had no idea what to do with them
plus it is small and reasonably light so i can take it with me to and from work
so we got a good deal on hsn for an ascer notebook and we bought it for him
this laptop is a great price and has a sleek look
this laptop rocks only wish it could run solidworks cad which apple doesnt support
windows 81 has its pros and cons
it took toshiba tech support 4 calls and 4 different techs to correct the problem
i have had the macbook pro for 1 12 years and i have found that it crashes as much as windows
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses
its a bummer and one out of five is being kind
yes its running and old type processor so hey dont even try gaming on it
very longlife battery up to 1011 hours depending on how you configure power level settings
bottom line i doubt youd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine
the difference in the apple keyboard from a pcs keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to but overall its worth it
i think i might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion
i took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it
i have been a linux ubuntu and fedora user for a while because windows doesnt appeal to me and it is similar to ubuntu and fedora but with trackpad gestures notification center and i can run itunes i couldnt get it to run on linux
i have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop
once i get a working computer i think i will like it
i thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldnt go onto our wireless network and i wouldnt have the same problems because it was updated
despite the fact that theres no optical drive everything is perfect
the windows 7 starter is in my opinion a great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics
the battery life also doesnt keep up with the claim but still i think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent
i upgraded to windows 81 and repeated the sequence on software loads
i dont use my laptop in a way though that needs a long battery life so its perfect for me
its priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box
however the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets
can not believe the price
it also has a big new scratch on the top cover
oh it is such a great piece of equipment
its fast and another thing i like is that it has three usb ports
comfterbale to use light easy to transport
extremely slow
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once it never slows down
i have so much trouble turning the computer on
blends in with any accessory you use with it
the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily
im new just switched from years of pc frustration
i highly recommend this computer for students looking for a solid machine to get them through college
was not happy with one of the programs on it
the computer is as expected and worth the money
the average computer user will be served better by a macbook air since it is faster for basic tasks lighter and has a higherres antiglare screen
this unit will replace my old desktop
reliability throughout the past few years i have had no problems with the macbook pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws
i also love the design the looks the feel and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull
the wireless adapter is strong and the ssd is fast
it is also very lightweight making transporting this computer very easy
the wifi rumor hasnt happened to me
along with email and playing angry birds
now the graphics are not hdand the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic
also i have found the touch pad to be awkward to use could be i am pressing too hard perhaps and the screen is well underwhelming
externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit and the screen has a terrible glare
it is a thing of beauty and fast enough
it has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard
o it is very cost efficient for college students compared to other options
she had a pc
bought a usb dvd rw drive but have not used it yet
the screenvideo resolution wont increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60
lets just get this out of the way i love apple
its nice to have the higherend laptops but this fits my budget and the features i need
my mistake was to not research this one no dvd and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures
i went to my local best buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke
i love windows 7 but i cant give toshiba any credit for that unless yall get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive i will be looking to different manufacturer next time
the video card is great for media and above average for gaming but not a gamers first choice
it works great for general internet use microsoft office apps home bookkeeping etc
i bought my first macbook after seeing the product demonstrated
im really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer
hp didnt fix it
can run csgo at 60 fps on low settings
love it
aside from the trial software and the short battery life lack of a webcam its great
have always been a pc guy but decided to try apple
there is a chance mine is defective but regardless im not going to try another one this is a terrible product
still trying to learn how to use it
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space
i had a number of updates to do and customization
that includes transferring my music and movies
the seller was amazing to work with on my return
the build is perfect the screen fantastic but i do have a bit of a problem with the fact that i have to buy adaptors for nearly everything from vga cables to ethernet cables so almost perfect
after that i turned to email in my next vain help to get them to acknowledge that the warranty was still valid
i use my friends and familys 2000 laptops and they are fast and reliable and hp well ill never buy or recommend an hp to anyone
slow processor just not it
this computer is absolutely amazing
lots of preloaded software
battery could be better but it has robust processor and plenty of ram so that is a trade off i suppose
mehbut cheap
ill stick to tashiba
although ive had it for less than a week i am very satisfied
i use this for my tutoring business and since im always bouncing from student to student it is ideal for portability and battery life yes it gets the 8 hours as advertised
the retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date
its fast powerful screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for a laptop of this size
great laptop for school easy to use for beginners in the household
good product for a good price
clear picture on it and everything
as a matter of fact no matter how many times i asked that question the employees i spoke purposely ignored it
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat
it really is perfect for work and play
it contains a long battery life incredible specs and an overall enjoyable performance
i havent really officially tested it yet but its a long time
it powers onoff very quickly and it loads up automatically
my favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so i can connect it to a bigger screen
i took 34 years researching brands and prices of laptops
there is so much room
may be better for the occasional web surfer
its portable reliable and great for what i use it for
the windows 81 used to boot in just 2s and that was freaking awesome
i will have to say that i love my macbook pro
unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop dont buy this
another thing is that after only a month the left mouse key broke and it costed 175 to send it in to fix it
the laptop was very easy to set up
its a mac
this is a great bargain
the battery will get you from la to ny no problem
it has far exceeded my expectations for power storage and abilitiy
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst ive ever seen
i previously owned a toshiba and it only lasted about 2 years
i personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers
this md101lla handles very much like my imac
very very slow laptop
when the macbook pro arrived i helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the pc to the mac an easy draganddrop process utilizing a flash drive
so im going back to genius bar for visit 6
this machine delivers
i put that free app on for word processing and it works like a charm
if you want to travel with this laptop dont buy it
i was unable to download itunes to it
it would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes
the macbook pro 133 inch laptop is for those who want to use a mac but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution
the only pro to this computer is it was under 600
it is super fast and always loads
one of them seems to have worked
tried to make a recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk
after doing much research for a laptop that had all the features i was looking for this one hit all the criteria i had
the display is incredibly bright much brighter than my powerbook and very crisp
how could you not love a mac
the touch pad takes a little getting used to as the click buttons are on top instead of the bottom
i enjoy the simplicity and userfriendly interface of yosemite
looks like this dell is a piece of crap
there are several programs for school or office use pages numbers keynote etc music garageband photo management photo booth iphoto videoediting or moviemaking imovie etc
all in all great item highly recommend it
my next laptop will also be a mac
it took me a while top get away from the land of pcs but now that i have i cant see myself going back to it
a couple office products and occasionally watched tv on
not as fast as i would have liked it to be but everything else is great
terrific value for the money
i highly recommend this product
it took a little over 2 weeks until i got it back
i also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows 7 on it by using the vmware program
im sure you wont regret making this purchase
it is a great value for what you get
it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one
thats the only issue ive ever had since working on macs in 1995
when i saw this i grabbed it
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance picture quality and ease of use
if your on a budget save up longer
easy learning curve
got it directly from asus
the screen is wide and provides excellent clarity
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will
i do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have a tv
the builtin webcam is great for skype and similar videochat services
i saved for this laptop for 3 months and i can tell you personally it was worth the wait
returned it
sadly apple has discontinued this macbook i think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller pros
there is a little indent to help open it but good luck with that
i have found it very easy to use very imformative wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs
the computer is very wonderful
if you are undecided between a desktop or laptop pc i strongly recommend this pc as a solution
if you are looking for a netbook pc do not buy from asus
it is the cheapest product in the line of macbooks
this is now my 3rd macbook pro and i really honestly love it
i give this laptop a five star review i love it and it has done chams for me
i hate plugging my laptop in because i dont want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery but with this laptop i rarely have to charge it
having someone give you a quick tour of how tos is the best
i actually had the hard drive replaced twice the mother board once the dvd drive twice then they finally agreed to replace it all of this in less than 1 12 yearsonly to get another hpcompaq piece of crap
i love the size keyboard the functions
its not just slow on the internet its slow in general
this is a complete waste of money dont let the price fool you
i would rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a toshiba that isnt good at all
i found a 2gb stick for a bit under 50
trust me
the sound is a bit quiet if youre on a plane this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones
works well fast and no reboots
probably not ever again
i have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses 3 times and i have not even had it for more then 4 months
it is sleek smooth and lightweight
the computer loads in about a 110th of the time that my pc did and i have all of the programs that were on my pc
the laptop is very responsice with the core i7 processor and 8gb of ram and the sound out of the beats audio is great
i was psyched
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design
i bought this laptop in november 2013
i can use it for all of my needs
now he mows yards so he can earn the money for the wireless internet
not enough time for me to give it 5 stars
dont waste your money or time
i took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it
i will never buy anything from hp again
i tried turning it done but it did nothing
just save your money and get something better
i bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her its very lightweight and the response for the computing shes doing internet focused activity mail research etc is excellent
everything was so easy
now im looking into the return process which im sure will just be loads of fun if my prior experience is any indication
great laptop
summary after doing some investigation on the web i have found that toshiba nb205s are not chronically not booting
the computer blinks it shuts off at will
it has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but thats all i use anyway
however if you really need a disc player apple sells one that connects to your usb port
my previous laptop served me well and i am very with its replacement
this laptop is insane
i am totally satisfied with my little toshie
ive owned every pro model apple laptop for the last 8 years this is by far the worst one ive ever had
im already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown
its face and depanable
good bye blue screen and critical errors
to go left i have to go right and vice versa and to go up i have to go down
i even installed a windows partition to be able to run windows software
good battery life as well
let me start with the goodso awesome
im a very weak girl and i could lift this laptop with one hand however id get tired soon lol
machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen
everything about this computer is easy to use
i recently purchased this model of the macbook pro
great os fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port
simply amazing computer
it came back today
even for a 4gb ram it barely chugs with 3 tabs open
if you have the money i suggest going for the i7
this laptop is the most amazing little peice of machinery i have owned outside of the iphone
i have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts
cons 1 if you fall behind in updates your laptop will become progressively slower just update itthen its back to normal
battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshibas reputation for laptops its great
the rep did not even answer my question i had to ask him if he understood what i ask or if he spoke english because he didnt even try to acknowledge my question
lastly because it can flip 360 you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch a show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard
im also not a fan of windows 8 but fortunately i can install whatever i want on the laptop without issue
for 2 months
i had issues with acer but my dells just seem to keep going
i am using the external speaker sound is good
will probably never buy a hp again
i still dont get why retina displays are standard on most new ios devices but are only available on the macbook pro with retina display total cheapskate
this computer will last you at least 7 years thats an amazing life spanned an electronic
i have had my new macbook pro i5 for a couple of days and have recycled all of my old pc laptops
i do not go on social networks i only do word documents check my email and shopping
very dissappointed becase i have had toshibas for years and never a issue
also the laptop is quite no more burnt laps best screen display and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over
we purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive hp needed to be repaired
on my powerbook g4 i would never use the trackpad i would use an external mouse because i didnt like the trackpad
2 viewing angles are not great
it takes for ever to wake it up
mine has been though hundreds of parties weddings quinces anything involving performances it can take it
i was very impressed by the sellers speedy twoday delivery which was free
what an elegant wonderful machine
ill keep trying however
all the newer macbooks do not
iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos
once i removed all the software the laptop loads in 1520 seconds
the benefits were immediate
can even readmy kindle on this computer
i had meant to purchase the nb205 and bought this one by accident long story
its more expensive but well worth it in the long run
i have been an apple user since they switched to intel
this is going to be random and unorganized but here are my thoughts on the laptopso far so good after a month
i dont like it at all
i play sims 4 and 3 on it all the time with very little issues
i switched to an apple airbook and love it
never been hacked
was the best decision we ever made
i custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent
failed
i went through all of the customer service options
its a great prodcut to handle basic computing needs
a month later we reinstall the os vista
ive tried going back to xl but there still problems
the touch pad is among the best
if you are looking for a light durable and extremely effecient laptop buy this one
the price and features more than met my needs
the display is beyond horrible
its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action
not bad for the price
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it
the first thing i can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portablethis with a relatively clear screen is a bonus
you get what you pay for right
if you buy this dont go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life and youll be perfectly satisfied
out of all the laptops i have owned this is by far the best
called tech support and got the usual acer we dont support software but for we can help you i explained there was no software involved in booting
this laptop isnt worth a single cent
replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy a couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play
i should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got a full sized computer
my wife and i decided to get a mac desktop several years ago
i cannot be happier with the service or product
this mac allows all of that
this is mostly not an issue since i mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times
works good but doesnt seem like its made sturdy
acer wont replace the laptop
i cant believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes
it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again
i love my new computer
the battery life seems to be very good and have had no issues with it
and at one point they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when i upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop i bought the memory stick they recomended
by far the best laptop ive ever had
i saw this one and i have the most difficult time trying to use them theyve made great dust collectors i hate putting this computer down
the thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go
i would have to say that overall its great
i really wanted a mac over a pc because i used a mac in high school
they dont go very loud at all
in addition there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture
for me five stars is not enough
again the same problem the right speaker did not work
if you are a gamer or need it for heavy computer use get something else
the only major negative to me is windows 81 though ymmv and the dell crapware installed
i completely recommend it
i waited and waited and no laptop
so far a great product
great pick for portability and affordability
keyboard is reasonable size
overall a great laptop for simply doing basic things and webbrowsing
i find myself adjusting it regularly
if what you need is a machine to do some surfing email checking word processing and watching a movie or two this is the machine you want
during that time i had to send it back 3 times
2 blue screen first month
simple to use and great graphics
the toshiba net book operates very well
it was too cheaply constructed
one night i turned the freaking thing off after using it the next day i turn it on no gui screen all dark power light steady hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does
they claim they will have it back in six working days
great labtop
those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs
i use my mouse so not a problem for me
it is very difficult to use this computer
i purchased my macbook pro retina from my school since i had a student discount but i would gladly purchase it from amazon for full price again if i had too
the mac app store is your onestop shop for mac software though you can also download software online at your own risk
it churns out hd content runs without many flaws and ive yet to get a virus on a mac since i started using the platform in the early 1990s
other than that its a great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more
second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare
i know i didnt get this laptop through amazon but i wanted to write a review
at least those computers didnt just die on me like this one
they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars
one really nice thing about lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with a bunch or trial software
excellent speed for processing data
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college
dont waste their money save it and but a mac
i bought this laptop computer for my parents they only access their facebook and email accounts see family pictures etc
love it love it love it
i went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it
i can not even read what i am writing half of the time
a good value on a quality product
but if you are just an average user it works really great
i even got my teenage son one because of the features that it offers like ichat photobooth garage band and more
its the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use and while it is a little heaver than the macbook air at 5ish pounds its really not that bad
the apple care has never failed me and i expect it to be the same for this computer as well
average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly
i will update it if i get it working with the procedure
this was an update from an early macbook pro
i cant say enough good for it
now i have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac
i am using primarily for office and outlook while im on the road
i would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school
but if you cant make your product last more than a year you will not get my business again
just a bunch of idiots whos english as a 5th language is forced at best
i plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked no fuss no muss
hands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far
you dont want to show this to anyone
overall for the money this is a good deal
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed
i just bought this laptop 3 days ago
and it is impossible to get them back in
it rarely works and when it does its incredibly slow
sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size
keyboard is sturdy
speakers too small to be of any real use
i am able to organize my pics music and files easily
i also love the small convenient size of my laptop making it a perfect tool for my academic studies
my only problem is i can not reg the product key
it cant get any better
3 weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications
do a quick search on the internet see if im the only one
what a great little laptop
waited on getting this computer but it has been a great change
i use it for school its quick and has everything i need on it
while the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks
it doesnt heat up like my old laptop
charger seems large for this class of computer
so i look all over the internet and i checked the settings and there was nothing
this is what they told me it heats up and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops and simply categorize them as portables
keyboard good sized and wasy to use
i bought this laptop was the worst laptop ive ever bought
i suggest getting a case
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where i lived
i also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have
dont expect great graphics though
it is truly a desktop replacement
at first it worked well for a month or so then the system board failed and i send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later i then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now i have to send it back again to get it fixed again
my last laptop had terrible battery life lasting only about an hour on a full charge so this isnt too shabby at all for a laptop
not good for a person who gets online daily
i bought it for really cheap also and its amazing
still under warrenty so called toshiba no help at all
note no dvd drive no ethernet port
for windows users who are used to using microsoft office you can buy a license for the latest microsoft office software for mac currently 2011 at any of apples retail stores apple authorised resellers any store that sells microsoft office for mac or downloading the software directly from microsofts website
while i mostly use it for email internet and gaming im confident all other applications live up to the high standard ive come to appreciate from mac laptops
the retina display of my iphone 5 has indeed spoiled me and apple should update the screen of the mbp 13 or bring down the price of the retina model
i thought the price was great for the specs
the laptop is beautiful not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with a full keyboard
after 2030 min the screen of the notebook switched off
if you draw on the other hand im sure you will love using this in tablet mode
i called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem
trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything so i want to manage my time i do have to be the most efficient
summary spend your money elsewhere
so yes it is ridiculously fast
it has some bloat wear that i wish werent there
the retinal display laptops dont allow for much tinkering
it worked super fast and got the job done
the os is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly
from the moment i opened the box to the present it has been a great joy
the battery gets so hot it is scary
i couldnt believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge
the place we bought it from said that after they send it out to gateway 4 times they would give us a new one
this thing boots in just a few seconds which is nice
the only thing i dont understand is that the resolution of the screen isnt high enough for some pages such as yahoomail
i bought for my son in the 2nd grade
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp
took it back as it was defective
he received it and one day later it dies
it does not turn on if i take the battery out it might work not sure if its a bad battery or computer
the most amazing part to me as a pc user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing
this laptop is nice
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphonesmic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction
its exactly like the picture and i am satisfied
maybe this one is just a dud
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a pc
applications respond immediately not like the tired ms applications
this laptop meets every expectation and windows 7 is great
i consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need
here is my take on all of this the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product
i definitely will buy a mac again if and when this computer ever fails
however i can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive
finally they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement
all of them were windows machines
the programs are great like iphoto love the editing capabilities imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad imovie etc
i have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all
plus no russian input wtf
we now own two of these identical
i like the 13 inch macbooks
battery doesnt hold up to what it said in the description but i got it refurbd and i imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price just a guess
easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops
its even easy to hook up to other wireless networks
this just keeps having its hard drive replaced
pros 1 amazing storage both 500gig and 750gig
windows 7 starter is terrific no you cant change the background but i dont need to i use it just for school work
i will never purchase a hp again ever
this is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life
the only downfall is the battery only last 1520 hrs when not plugged in
i used the ctrlesc keys while turning on and still nothing
it is so much easier to use
i would easly reccomend this laptop to a friend
ive had lenovo computers before
im so glad that i have
i will be going back to windows when i replace this laptop
another issue i have with it is the battery
games being the main issue
its performing very well after a weeks use and i dont anticipate any trouble given my past experiences with dell pcs
with that being said for the price 800 you get a nice fast laptop but if you ask me its missing some things that i feel should be automatically included
problem solved
never had a single problem and dont have to worry about viruses
amazon had the best pricing and the delivery was on time
5 cut my losses and sold it for parts
it made me sign up with microsoft and sometimes wont let me download things that are harmful to my computer but thats what anti virus software is for lol
this was my first mac so i wasnt familiar with how it was suppose to feel
apple continues to shine and provide a much more enjoyable computer experience
ios does everything its billed to do and much much more
6still feels too heavy to me
im actually writing this review on my new macbook and i love it
so after apple replaced the hard drive i enjoyed another 4 months of my new computer until it froze this morningcompletely
ive had it for more than a year and ive found that no antivirus software is needed as long as you dont download anything without being 100 sure that its from a legitimate source
the body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up
stopped booting up less than a week after my oneyear warranty was up
all apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed
they sent it back with a huge crack in it and it still didnt work
i wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff
so far so good with this laptop
take the simple easy solution to your computer problems and stop waiting and smacking your old computer around
very fast and good for most steam games
they were able to setup with labtops themselves within a few minutes
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is
the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies pictures and etc
this computer was awful i would never recomend it to another person
i spent 2200 dollars on a top of the line laptop
and im still paying the bloody financing for a product which didnt last me at least three years
no laptop is perfect but sometimes you just find a computer that works for you
keys stick periodically and i havent had the laptop for 45 days yet
the mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us
after that the said it was under warranty
pretty good laptop
the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it
my hp seemed great at first then the problems startedwireless adapter would just quotdisappearquot and the system said it didnt have a network card
perfect trifecta
after talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate i chose the macbook pro over the white macbook
got another 1 and same issue
i love the 15 macbook pro
others have posted about this keyboard issue
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan
this company just wants customers money in their pocket
however i am very upset that it doesnt have the superdrive built in
in the shop these macbooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it get it home break the seal and use it very clever con
if i were to have any technical difficulties the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap it was quite impressive
i recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it
i can say that i am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied
i hate windows 8
update november 1 2012 on my last visit to the genius bar they sent the machine in to replace the motherboard
just dont waste your time and money on this
so far i am very happy with this computer
i just love this ultrabook
for the not so good i got the stock screen which is very glossy
but alas they were giftsand what is a gift if not given
its just a little slow
it was a great deal after all
overall great for me
i bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio
other than that i would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semidecent gaming capabilities
i would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a desktop it does not meet the expectations
this asus youre looking at right here and that im typing on right now has one
im a lifelong desktop computer user and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to a normal keyboard as ive ever seen
slow
ships fast
graphics are clean and sharp internet interfaces are seamless
i have loved this since i took it out of the box
the metal is very expensive feeling
if i had to buy another computer i would most definetly buy an acer one computer
locks up she searching for updates
my laptop was under coverage but when i gave it to them for repairs they quoted me 755 for it
i returned the computer to hp and they kept it for 3 months
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot
while there are occasions that my computer will freeze or will need to be manually shut down this occurs far less frequently than on pc computers and laptops that ive used
great laptop light and very versatile
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june 24 and returned on july 2 seems like a short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned
in addition no matter what i do to change the settings adddelete flash etc firefox hangs on startup
us 30 comes with the mbp and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps
happy shopping guys
also many software programs are not compatible with the ios platform
it was secure and easy to navigate
the keyboard is not as easy to use as my old sony
a little pricey but it is well well worth it
best thing is i can use existing 32 bit old programs
this lap top is good so far
3fairly fast
lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a fivestar purchase but for the price this is a four star good computer
it took some getting used to on the widows 81 after being an xp user for many years
most of the large bags are for a 17 inch
this added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money detracts from the computers value
i previously owned an hp desktop and a dell laptop
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me
the aftermarket battery seems better than hps
the keyboard has a wonderful nature feel
plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop i really dont have anything to compare it to
its a great product for a great price
i am very happy
this laptop will last you a half decade if not a full decade
i constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed
needless to say not to happy with the product
it has a 128 gb storage capacity but with the option of a 256 gb hard drive and a 16ghz dualcore intel core i5 so dont expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too
bigger screen than expected laptop with a desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage including programmingediting
ive been using apples since 1992 and this is the fastest and best one ive had
this is the first time that i tried and owning a netbook although i have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years i find not much difference except of course for the screen size
the trackpad is pretty crappy but arent they all
have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing which is leaps and bounds ahead of pc in my opinion
i cant believe hp put this out
but the macbook is the best
supper east to use
this computer overall is great
going to bring it to service today
it comes on for seconds then shuts itself off
to download microsoft office go to microsofts website and download the trial version
i can run most games to a good quality without seeing any lack of speed
very pour performance
o it is extremely user friendly
i am going to go back and return at store i bought from
i would like at least a 4 hr battery life
a great computer for light home use and business use
apparently under the screen there are 2 little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose
right out of the box this little netbook did everything i asked of it including streaming the everyday video youre bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously
i would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality
nice laptop
i would love to keep this laptop but will be sending it back and looking for a different brand
this device serves all modern requirements is a very strong game and is very useful for designers
the lettering wore off the keys so you better be able to type blind
they were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day
any suggestion for a solution
the 81way different than my other computer so we have to get use to it
i finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what i need it
it crashes and when it goes flat it just dies like a pc maybe worse and i loose all my open documents
i dual boot with linux and that other securityprone os and it performs flawlessly
i get a ton of compliments on its size and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus i can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if youre restricted to the width of your body for computing room
so if youre thinking of a laptop i would heartily recommend theapple 133 macbook pro notebook computer z0j80001 notebook for all your needs
sounds like a washer
luckily that was not the case
i was disappointed
i bought it simply for excel on windows for work since i have a macbook air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening excel or my web browser
small enough to use on a long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips
ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple
the toshiba laptop was a great purchase
they definitely have a superior product
retina screen solid build quality weight fast processor and the reliability of the apple brand
also and this maybe is another personal quirk but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop
i have used both pcs and macs and i have to say that i really really love my mac book pro
the macbooks worth every penny
but heres something i hadnt realized before buying it there isnt an optical drive which means no cds or dvds
fast enough for my purposes
they tried to tell me that the battery wasnt covered by the warranty and it costs about 150 to replace
5 bought the 3 year warranty and boy it was needed because of my doings
furthermore mac os x mountain lions gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed
the hp envy 15 has been everything i expected
the other issue i had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it
i hate it
it is in the best condition and has a really high quality
others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen but i never use the laptop where im not looking straight at it so it doesnt bother me
mac user interface is just the best
i love my new thinkpad
great laptop for the price
accordingly i have decided to never purchase another hp product my five year old compaq lasted 5years before the hard drive crashed
i like it
the best computer ive ever bought
the perfect notebook
our apple 133 macbook pro notebook computer z0j80001 notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking
it is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me
because we did not purchase the extended warranty in time we are on the hook for the repair
the screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice
the only con is windows effin 8
all my devices work flawlessly
the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop
have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever
i own other macs but always find myself navigation to the macbook pro to get my work done
terrific laptop
its charged the light comes on
they dont crash
the first fell apart right after the 1yearwarranty
summary ive had this laptop for 2 months out of the blue the power adapter stops working
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way i thought it would of run
it takes less time to power up and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode
i told her amp34real menamp34 use pcs because of the challenge it keeps you sharp technically
but apple does not pretend it has any of these
the system constantly overheats the battery life is too short the case is coming apart and my core applications that i use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly
this has been nothing but a headache since we purchased it
does what i need it to do and the price was right
there are a lot of things a laptop can do these days and if you ask me many of them should be automatically included in every laptop no matter what
i could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat
overall its ok
prior to this computer i owned a powerbook g4 for 6 years quite a long time for a laptop
i bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room
used 6 times black screen returned for refund
i have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first 5 months after purchasing it
this laptop was made for art music beatmaking pictures movies graphic design
the computer itself is a good product but the repair depot stinks
5 months dead again
glare is also pretty frustrating
i can guarantee this will be the last dell i will ever purchase
the machine now has 10 gigs of ram and it works just fine
this laptop is amazing
but it doesnt have a cd unit anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting
though i dont have much installed i only have 96 of the 278g left
the macbook pro with a 133inch screen was the first computer i ever purchased
overall this laptop is definitely a keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from
my new laptop is great
ultimately decided on this one because of the processor and having a fan i read a lot of reviews about the zenbook becoming uncomfortably hot during heavy use which doesnt make sense considering it is a laptop
the acer one computer that i bought is 17 ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it but i like the big screen on it
in addition if mac osx is not something you enjoy using then i would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop
we like this new laptop a lot
ive used the pairing tool which is located in the windows directory
it lasts up to 56 hours with normal use
it has many great programs such as ilife iphotos and others
heck if i had enough money i would but it as a gift for someone
wrong
i really have nothing negative to say about it
the processor a amd semprom at 21 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up not able to connect
i cant say enough of how satisfied i am with their product and help aftermarket
microsoft office is a 30 day trial a number of games and apps are already preloaded
so if you dont have kids or not in high school or dont accidently sit on it it should be fine
the only thing that i have is the key broad is a little dark to see the letters would help if it was a little lighter then it is
my mac laptop is fabulous in both areas
this netbook went bad on me after 3 days
lenovo is the best laptop
three years ago i had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great
this is early days for a review since i took delivery of this only today
it wakes in less than a second when i open the lid
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself with help of friends and even help from computer experts i have given up on trying to fix it
just what i expected
when i decided to buy my first computer i wish i had bought a mac first
looks good well built and very good speed
the only issue i had was with the harddrive
apple doesnt cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care
and if you are going to deal with hp be careful
also i find os x much more simple and easy to use than windows
ive been a pc user and i just finally switched and i am never going back
my information was all lost my fault i know but i never thought i would need to back up my information on a brand new mac the paragon of all computers
i think it may have to be apple dont care instead of apple care
i also travel with it and it never gives me any problems
a smaller touchpad would make life easier for computer science students or it people much more easier
the display is vibrant and clear the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on
it makes it much more exciting to play
there is somewhat of a learning curve but the operating system and hardware of this mac are great
i would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy
i am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite i like the extra features i love the windows 7 home premium
the mouse is a little bit different than what youre used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly
got this for a graduation gift for my daughter for her to use at college
i can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead
this should be more than enough computer for almost everyone
computer has been at service facility more than in my hands
get this computer for portability and fast processing
its a joke
i had always used pcs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed operating systems that were never very intuitive
but i should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen its certainly good enough for the average person but if youre used to good screens this may bother you a bit but its certainly not unbearable by anyones standards
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east
i was nervous at first that i purchased a lemon but the user manual explains how to turn on the keyboard backlight
this computer that i have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions
otherwise i am happily a mac user
after much effort and 10 days asus replaced it
this is an ok computer
so glad i decided to upgrade
it took 3 days to make an appointment at the local apple store
ive had to call tech support many times
great laptop that offers many great features
medium settings on titles like tomb raider for it to be acceptable 60 fps is the minimum acceptable fps pcmasterrace
im going to try and keep my old g4 on the road for as long as possible
this is the first apple product that i have purchased
i do a lot of 10key so i cant be pecking around at the top looking for numbers
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures
windows runs very poorly
ive been to the amp34geniusamp34 bar several times they have been very nice
i had an old laptop running windows xp that i used at home for email
shiny
i would definitely recommend this
so you can imagine how unhappy i am with this item
buyer beware
the resolution is excellent
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis
satisfy what i paid for it
i can bat around all the things that everyone else says but its been what weve been using for decades and i have nothing bad to say
its been a year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is a bummer
just what the doctor ordered
three weeks after i bought the netbook the screen quit working
i actually spent 600 on a pc before i bought this macbook and returned it with 24 hours because it was slow and i could not stand windows 10
unfortunately that is not the case
no ethernet outlet
do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop
got it for my wife
durability my computer has fallen from small heights and has had a few spills on it but has had no lasting damage to the console with only a light plastic case on it
so far so good
i would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop and the battery life is amazing
the macbook starts fast doesnt crash has a fantastic display is small and light i have the 133 model and isnt always complaining about updates lost connections errors blue screens etc
so i gave this 4 stars but only because of the poor picture quality other than that it is a great buy
i love this little one
i fell in love with it
it makes the mbp very durable and protects it from scratches though you shouldnt go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it
hp please fix it
besides the great look it is a great machine
the wireless keyboard not bluetooth but rf did not pair up with the device
keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel
before we got this laptop hadacompaq pasarofor 5 years with no problems
my only concern is that since the battery is not external i will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold a good charge over a length of time
obviously this macbook is perfect for me because it does exactly what i need in an easytofunction way
fewer security issues no he said she said between the software and hardware companies and it works
they offer the best warranty in the business and dont 3rd party it out like toshiba
also i have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines
the apps are very easy to use
it is very very quiet
it is everything id hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint but somehow a bit more sturdy
get a probook instead
now the question is who is this computer for
no bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall
all i can say is i am impressed
they click
the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files
needs constant repair
i also like i have the option to push calendars photos and contacts to an ipad ipod touch or iphone if i had any of those
thats the downside for me
battery power laptop had difficulties computing
took the netbook on a vacation trip and i was able to do whatever i wanted to do without lugging a much heavier laptop
i can use it anywhere
the battery has never worked well
i have had one complaint into the supplier but got little support
waiting is horrible and not waiting is the best thing on earth
a masterpiece of crap
you wont be disappointed with this computer
the processor is roughly 15 faster than the one inside the macbook air which also extends this computers usable lifespan
i cant imagine ever buying a pc again
no need to
i hope you dont make the same mistake
the leather carrying case keyboard and mouse arrived in two days from memphis warehouse
i find it hard to navigate from screen to screen
i just got this laptop for college and so far i am very happy with it
the macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box all the functions works great
the screen is big and everything was as described
wonderful features
the cover is a soft rubber texture without the friction
now 17 months later they want would not say exact amount 16500 to 400 to fix the machine
i occassionaly use it for work via vpn and it has not given me any problems
the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all
apps launch super fast and the 500gb hdd is more than sufficient
maybe not the cutting edge satellite l455d but it is a workhorse
it was a great purchase
everything youd expect from a mac
i dont want to run a computer i want to use a computer
i am loyal to apple
they are loud and clunky but i figured id get used to it
my hp is very heavy
for everyday use you cant really go wrong with this laptop
so i called compaq and after being on the phone for 3 hours i finally got a replacement which i shouldnt have had a problem getting since it was under warranty
i defenitly recommend it for anyone for office and home work
going to see what lenovo does
i am really not happy with this computer
i love the keyboard
updates and plugins should also be treated with caution its a good idea to google first and see whether other users have had problems with these items
it has a 10 hour battery life when youre doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing itll have a battery life of just over 5 hours
im returning mine
the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times
i love this computer this is my first ever mac im 21 and it took a little while to switch over from the os i was used to but it was a fast learning curve
the only problem is a lack of screen resolutions
the investment is worth it
usability the macbook pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesnt necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers
the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones i have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music i suggest you get something better
works at a decent speed
the battery life is probably an hour at best
i initially purchased my macbook pro 13 in april and i loved it
im not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand 129 for a new battery 39 to replace it and 139 for a new keyboard
true quality at a great price
love everything about this laptop
i love it so much
it is the worst computer dell ever made
had some trouble finding a case that it would fit in
although i opted for the lowest end macbook pro this thing holds its own
i love the mac so much better than my work pc
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier
its just a matter of getting used to the touchpad commands
i live in jamaica and bought this online and my husband took it down for me
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and i love snow leopard x
i took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling
still have my ibook g4 i bought in 2005
this laptop has no touchscreen optical drives ok a bit of a stretch because that would eat up precious space in this monster swivel or detachable screen
they didnt even try to assist me or even offer a replacement
1 payed 2200 for a premium laptop
this is not my first dell laptop
odd unusual dell commands
thank you best buy for putting my computer together and installing my first software you guys were great too
i have had the luxury sarcasm of owning 2 of these laptops
it is made better thicker and all out tough
it works fine for a pc in this price range
this notebook restarts every time there is a new update so if you dont save your files and information everything will be lost
i have the cinema display not the retina
the keyboard is like no other laptop keyboard
i really like the video option on it i stream movies on amazon prime and netflix and there is no lag
i got this laptop as an upgrade replacement for my old lenovo notebook
if you are an avid cd listener though or want to watch dvds from your laptop i would suggest buying the separate disc drive
once open the leading edge is razor sharp
if people are writing bad reviews about this laptop then believe what they say
the display is good quality
i now realize that my 900 would have been better spent on a windows laptop
i bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework its not a fast computer but its great for what she needs it for and very light weight
that was my first apple product and since then i have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs i have bought
i should have bought one a long time ago
the flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os x
i just tried to restart it
the touchpad hasnt worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning i thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads ive worked with have some inherent oddities
i am a huge computer person i love anykind of computer that works well but when i got this one i was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing
2in1 capability the ease of switching this laptop into a tablet is a huge plus
i tell everyone that i know friends family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used
the mouse buttons are hard to push
ive been a loyal dell user for quite some time
five starts
the 13 macbook pro is portable durable and very capable
i paid the 100 for professional version to join it to our server and private business network
i wouldnt expect anything less
this is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine
it has plenty of memory lots of hard drive and great graphics
only thing i would want to add to this is an internal bluray readwrite drive
and i have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them
easy setup and delivers all the functions we need
i was wrong
it was a hard decision for me since the macbook pro looked so appealing
it may take a little getting used to but you dont have to worry about viruses or other headaches
it has a quick start up and shut down time
in the past four years ive had it i have never once gotten a virus
the only problem i have is with windows 8
would like more trendy high tech features
the processor screams and because of the unique way that apple osx 16 functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software
for 250 which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value
i had in the past a dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it
ive had my fair share of mobile devices aka laptops made by hp or some other company but thisis wonderful
breaks easily
so this review might be a tad bit bias
retina display is beautiful
quite pleased with it
bought notebook 072009
like i said good for basic stuff and as a starter
i can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice
the size of has actually help me out quite a bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at a resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming
the 2 gb of ram is plenty able to run windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown
im still exploring the various features but overall i am satisfied with my purchase
other than the slow cpu it works great for everyday use
i normally dont participate in reviewssurveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts
i never have had a good result with this computer
used to love hp products but this has soured me on the whole company
i have had nothing but problems since the day i took it out of the box
it doesnt work worth a damn
i purchased two laptops for my husband and 16 year old daughter
enter your code printed on the back of your cd sleeve when prompted
if you want to game this thing can handle league of legends on mediumlow settings but i certainly wouldnt recommend it for gaming
my main use of the mac will be keeping inventory on my jewelry supplies
english must have been his third or fourth language
and of course the return window closed last week so now im stuck with it
i like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races
the laptop died two days after i received it
works good and is fast enough for me
now when i order i did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard i wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when i use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag
it seemed like a great computer and a great deal
from the start when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine
itunes is a handy musicmanagement program and it is essential for anyone with an ipod
not a necessity but something ive come to expect
overall i would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive
i really dont like it but i am stuck
definitely recommended
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesnt require a dedicated video card
beautifully done the computer is amazingly faster compared to other version of macbook pro i have had in the past
it takes a long time to load any page
i was told by my daughter that i was amp34stupidamp34 for spending so much time on a pc just to make it run when most of that amp34run stuffamp34 is taken care of by apple
i waited another month for approval and for them to build me a new laptop
it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on
immediately didnt like the track buttons
i know once i upgrade the ram to 8gb it will pick up a lot
although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks
i am able to play 720p and 1080p media files just fine with it
the toshiba satellite has been more than i expected for the price
was this computer refurbished
the pros a ton of storage space this laptop comes with 8gb of memory and a 1 tb 1000gb hard drive
peformance is good for the price
enjoy that toshib force and durability unparalleled
i have spent more than 25 hours on the phone with them over 4 different calls only to get no where
the dell is quick enough sturdy not good with finger prints
this has happened three times so far
we dont have to defrag deliete cookies run security programs or any of the common pc problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed
but if you are in the computer field you probably wouldnt be here
the first one arrived and it did not work
performance wise its a bit slow but thats to be expected from a celeronclass processor
i use a wireless mouse but the touch pad and the red button in the middle that works like a little joystick also work fine
i can actually get work done with this mac and not fight with it like my tired old pc laptop
tldr version good reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive
each time apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over
my apple mac book pro has crashed three times since i purchased it
although the price is higher then dell laptops the macbooks are worth the dough
this computer is very slow
the first one i had was a 2006 model not the pro
recommended to people as their first laptop
let me tell you this machine is great
i thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product
the retina is great its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the ssd storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well
the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more
i can easily get 10 hours out of a full charge
downloads are real fast compared to my netbook no comparison
it was nearly impossible to find a laptop that had a a side keyboard
it fast and easy to set up
my 15amp34 macbooks motherboard fried but i think that was a sugar spill that i never bothered cleaning up
the notebook is lacking a hdmi port and a svideo port that would enable one to hook it to a tv
came fully loaded good
seems the whole school at an academic level is going paperless
this is larger laptop but is not too heavy
i like it so much i bought another just for my wife
i have also used it to watch youtube and hulu
one os for this platform no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates
anyone had the same problem
i cant use the trackpad very well its too sensitive so i hooked up a mouse
glad i bought it
also i have no regrets about going with the 8gb ram because its super fast
save your money and go for a better device
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand
mom dad brother sister you name it
i dont love pcs but every pc ive ever owned has lasted longer than this macbook which costs much more than any of those pcs
asus always shows sold out
there are too many things to test
i think its because i always download my windows updates as reccomended
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which i am used to it being on the side
also the resale value on this will keep
get this now
he didnt specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his 65 posture it indicated something between the swat team and a bunch of lawyers
knowing that i am a mac fanboy it was a nobrainer that she asked me for this as a christmas present
this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials
how i hate laptops with touchscreen
it is so much fun to play with
also i have alot of trouble with it getting very hot and not even sitting on anything to make it hot
thank you
quick bootup and runs efficiently
i also bought one for my wife and 3 for my office
my daughter uses it for games email facebook pictures and music
i can do pretty much 75 of what i do on my desktop on my kitchen table
it is so simple to use i use it more than my desktop
hp pavilion dv9000 notebook pc when i first got this computer it really rocked
i will never ever buy any apple product in my life
the newer macbook that i have purchased is one of the best computers
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multitouch track pad is amazing
i love hp its the only computerprinter we will buy
this one in my opinion might be a lemon
super fast processor and really nice graphics card
this is an oversized 18inch laptop
its just a great toy to have around
if only bill gates would read some of what is said here ms would do a better job
seriously considering a larger laptop to replace the dell
no tey dont even support their own bios and it could be a problem with the bios how can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity
the people are frustrating to work with the product itself is very cheaply made and the accessories are less than satisfactory
i liked the fact that it came with windows 7 but also included windows 8 to install later if i need it
the touchpad is a little quotclunkyquot for my taste i use a small external mouse with laptops in any event
i will never complain about the price since i believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar
this computer was awful
i have a production pc which was much less expensive and way underspeced compared to this mac
the 156amp34 screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands
overall this laptop is great
i regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use
i was seduced by this computer so i took it home
nowi have a two one
the service i received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty
not worth it one bit
the free upgrade to mountain lion failed
steve jobs is dead so is apple
sometimes it comes back sometimes not
needs power and mouse cable to plug in back instead of side in the way of operating a mouse in small area
registration1st use is easy
would have exchanged instantly but had to use as if for college immediately
the only problem is that i had to add 1 gb ram the computer was kinda slow
so im disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is a priority
the last time we took it to get fixed the guy said that most likely it is a reppative problem and will keep happeneing so hopefully we can get a new one very soon
like so many others who do this there is a learning curve and im excited to do it
dont get me wrong i am no microsoft hater ive just managed to turn into a much bigger apple fan because of this machine
i have had a mac for 6 years and wont go back to pc
two weeks ago i bought this notebook
this was the only tabletstyle computer so far which met my requirements
compared other ultrabooks like zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of mac so stuck with macbook
so think about factoring those things in when you purchase
i will never buy refurbished again i dont cae how cheap it is
i bought this so that i could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than ipad was offering
i spent alot of money on this product and its been a nightmare
very happy
battery life my battery life is really good with this laptop and i have had no problems with it thus far
this computer was bought because i wanted top of the line fast reliable ha
the neat and organized icon list is a welcome change from cluttered and confusing desktop icons
i wavered between another toshiba and this and ended up choosing this and im so sorry i did
its a lemon
the unibody construction is solid sleek and beautiful
i use it everyday
i had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town
overall still a very nice machine
the cons no disc drive call me old fashioned but i still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box
this laptop is absolutely horrible
it fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and i have never had any issues with it freezing
i bought it to use in college and it is perfect
it certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out
the new macbook pro 15 inch i7 is nothing short of amazing
we got two days of operation from this laptop
opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever as do all programs that do not begin with an i
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan
im an amature so this does more than i can handle
literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind
as a student majoring computer science i really fell in love with this laptop
i was getting extrememly frustrated when i would want to do these simple taks that i would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my pc
i bought my first macbook exactly 5 months ago and was really happy with my new toy but what was not my surprise when i turned it on 2 days ago and the screen was completely black
i have used different laptops in the past and i have to rate this one way above the rest
i will never buy another lenovo anything
i am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing
would pay more for it if i had too
its easy to operate and its very light my parents are almost 60 yo they cant carry a heavy computer while traveling
uhhhhhh the computer looks good
battery life is above average and it charges quickly
if that is the case for you i would suggest a pullbehind solution when looking at cases
no bass sound at all
needed a new laptop and went for the windows 8 but i hated the new system maybe its just me but could not understand the drastic change and feeling like i had to do more compared to windows 7
bought from walmart i believe that this laptop was a repaired item
my very first laptop was a dell and it never failed me
i know people were complaining that it isnt the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter
instead they tightened a loose wire
i would recommend it to anyone
all of her professors and instructors use macintosh
page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something
then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so i was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running
and the best part is that it even comes with a free printer when they have a certain promotionoffer going of course
the only time i have restarted is during system updates
i dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers
i just bought this laptop yesterday
i was so excited to receive the toshiba l455 as a giftbonus for some work i had done for a friend of mine
help
posted nov 8 2010
boots up fast and runs great
i was said its videocard
when the ram arrived all 8 gigs were on one stick
not a geek or a wonk
there is definitely more to say
the macbook pro is useful for college students for many reasons
thank you for your great product
performs as advertised if not better
very disappointed
they are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat
2 months later the battery went
if you are a pc user looking to convert i would highly recommend it
within a day of usage it already slowed down significantly virus entered the system right away
yes a mac is much more money than the average laptop out there but there is no comparison in style speed and just cool factor
i had a toshiba for 10 years
i am constantly trying to uninstall programs clean cookies and delete unused files
instead of taking another chance on toshiba i went with an asus g73jhx3
my only issues are
in my house hp is a nasty word
was a great deal i will give that
do yourself a favor this is not a fake story trying to hurt alienware
keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable
i love it never had a computer i was so impressed with and ive had a lot of laptops and desktops this one is far and above the best one i ever had before
it seems that this computer might be a lemon
its just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open
but now i am having battery problems
fast easy
yeah i wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire
if you want a little more custom ability drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of win 7 and grab a 2gb stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more
i love it and would recommend it to everyone who is tired of the constant attention pcs require
not a big deal for me but if you skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a mac
oh and if thats not bad enough it doesnt come with a recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is 25 for two cds
thats a pretty impressive track record dont you think
this things run smoothly for its price and the battery life seems to go on forever
dealing with hp support is a ridiculous and painful experience
handles all my basic media needs easily
at first when i got this product i loved it
great pc light and powerful
i will have to purchase spy ware or nortell for privacy protection
for the price that i paid i feel that i got good value
i just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and i redownloaded my amazon music losing my ratings
but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever i am typing my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and its really annoying
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or i could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good
however i love this particular mac because its very fast great size and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen
ever since i bought this laptop so far ive experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services i received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines
this is a great value for the money
i had never owned a mac before
i am just amazed
vga really asus
i do not recommend this company or their products
speakers doesnt sound that great
this netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and i have another laptop or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks
i like those programs better than office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the office programs as well
very disappointing
the mouse click is a bit loud but it really isnt a problem
this computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing watching video word processing and thats about it
he gave me this pc about 3 years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it
i have found also it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access without having to have extra equipment andor complicated routes to take to be able to do so
the pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface
so i simply pulled one 2gb stick from the machine and installed the 8gb stick in its place
not bad
i prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else
the sound is great and its fast
help help other than that gets a great little wonder
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies
you will probably never use it in tablet mode but its nice to know you have that option
everything seems to be running smoothly
he explained to me the battery expansion is normal
overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves
i have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far and it is still as fast as it was when i first bought it
it would be a load on long trips where a lot of walking is required
laptop is to be used like a netbook
i have other computers that get strong signals that dont drop in places that this netbook loses its signal
i wasnt a big fan of the netbooks but this one was very well designed
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service
the battery life has not decreased since i bought it so im thrilled with that
this laptop was bad from the first day of usebrought it back to store for return of money
its a good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem
ive saved a lot of time and headaches so far using my new macbook pro
the mac book pro performs flawlessly
screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive
very quick to get it up and running with a minimum setup time right after you open the box
to be honest i think it was faulty equipment or something but idk
the program came with the computer and works beautifully
i hate this one
it is easy to navigate and update programs
the battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes
the laptop preformed pretty well
will probably get another one for my wife
either way highly annoying
well they dont care a bunch
would highly recommend this netbook though
enabling the battery timer is useless
the keyboard is backlit but you have to press the f5 key to turn it on
oh yea has no numeric pad on the side
when you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about 500
cannot even get to bios
i feel that it was poorly put together because once in a while different plasticpieceswould come off of it
screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with a normal adult finger
it was slow and might be problematic
love it so far
mac is not made for gaming
i baby my electronics so i know for a fact it was defective and not anything that i did to it
i was considering buying the air but in reality this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient even though its about 20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier
they told me to reprogram the computer and i didnt need to do that and i lost pictures of my oldests first 2 years of her life
ive only had this computer for a few days an i already dont like it
dont expect it to take good pictures or video
oh yeah dont forget the expensive shipping to and from hp
it just works flawlessly
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached
ive had it for a minth and so far its shut down completely 3 times
to a prospective buyer 08102012 once you go mac youll never go back
never any doubt i would get a macbook just wasnt sure which one
i would recommend this product
toshiba knows there is a manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it
did i mention everything about it from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk
too many steps to get anywhere and hard to set up
she cant tell the difference between it and her regular desktop system
i managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me
i had to call apple 19 times each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics 5 times
they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine told me there was a problem with the hardware so i now have a amp34refurbishedamp34 machine
i have not have any problems
im glad i bought this laptop it was worth the few 100 extra dollars
ive already recommended this laptop to a friend who eyed the computer when i took it out of my bag
quite simply this is the best laptop i have ever owned
if they can fix this i think it would be a very nice costeffective laptop
etc but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck
i know that everyone thinks macs are overpriced and overrated but once you get past the initial expense youll find that theyre worth every penny besides theres always the financing plan that best buy offers
the wifi works great
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and im hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator but i still expected better product quality for this price range
strange
fast great visual
very good performer for the price
it is so great i can hardly ever take my hands off it
and having to deal with the company has been a even worse nightmare
i will never go back to windows
i had to wait 3 weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly
the screen looked fine to me and wasnt an issue like others have been saying
i decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it
if you have zero dollars consider it
i tried not to jump on the apple bandwagon but youre just living in denial if you dont
dell sucks
this laptop serves all my needs
not to mention it has shit gigs
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site
the technical service for dell is so 3rd world it might as well not even bother
great product
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once
i had heard people speak highly of the macbook pro for college students and have not been disappointed through two and a half years of extensive use
i paid for extra memory and the 17inch screen as well as the top of the line dvd and cd burners
pay attention to the specs if you want these options
so i called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all i just chose to hide the message
will not buy another toshiba this is my second not happy w either
the games included are very good games
been a pc user for many many years
its a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen
replaced a 10 year old hp that never gave us a lick of trouble
its 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the superfast usb 30 which also comes with the mbp
i really like macapple products because of their operating system
the screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use very important for use quick typers
the 13 macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for a great product
also very quick laptop
i only use a laptop for personal use but this one cant even handle that
i guess those chinese workers really are unhappy
cant reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers
i acually believe the issue is with the nvidia grafics card but still requires a return
i got my macbook pro because i wanted to do all the stuff i need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes
i got it for christmas and i was so excited to set it up
but thats not a dealbreaker
but for the cost this is a winner
so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault
screen broke 1 month outside warranty
no problems no lock ups no disappointments
i highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from a laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door
the image is great and the soud is excelent
the laptop is a little more than an inch thick when closed
would purchase again
i would recommend not buying this product
the keyboard is slick and quiet and not bulky like some other laptops i have had in the past
great laptop from apple
memory is upgradable
i like the design rather sleek and light
there are currently around 10000 apps on the app store and counting and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store
love the graphics awesome programs including garageband and really cool default background
spent 2 hours on phone with hp technical support
i should have known better
its still going
was easy to get up and running and comes with windows 7 pro my favorite operating system so far do not like windows 8
the black model also has a very nice seamless appearance one of the better looking notebooks ive seen
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and im looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular
my house is now 100 macbook
the keyboard is top notch
previous laptops were pcs still have them but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system
i dont game a lot so i dont need a super hd display for that i use my appletv to display on my 52amp34 tv
after using my friends computer i knew something was wrong
i should have waited to find a higher quality computer
i am very satisfied with everything about this machine
im perfectly satisfied just have to get use to the new 61 system i cant see a problem
my husband uses it mostly for games email and music
if like me you will be paying bills occasionally reading the news or just buying stuff on line then this is a winner
so buyers beware
its been a very easy transition moving my windows created files over to the mac
i decided no enough was enough
it did not take long to get used to the mac os
i bought this pc to play games and stream movies it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on a cd
i wanted a laptop that had a cd drive since most new laptops do not have one a laptop with an actual hard drive since the new macbooks do not and i wanted to get away from pcs
for those that care about noise this thing doesnt really make any
do not buy you will be disappointed
i sent it back and they lost it
is just amazing
if this computer every breaks down on me i will most definatly get the same one again
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all
only downfall is the preloaded mcafee and other software
tons of bloatware and junk programs
i thought it would have a cdrom drive but there isnt one
i watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough
i wanted an i7 chip and i wanted one i could still work on
it is everything that i would want in a computer
i dont want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional
steve jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby
the one down side to it is that when i play a certin game on here it tends to freeze up sometimes but thats the only bad thing about this computer
heck i like all mac computers but theyre all way too pricey for the kind of economy the us is going through
the delivery was fast and i would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again
tosiba has a good reputation my llast computer was an acer
great color on screen
however the multitouch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless youre gaming
the desktop was clean once i got it up and running
the ease of set up was terrific
this is very fast high performance computer
it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere
i was tired or hodge lodge of software products security updates malware junk and endless upgrade trauma with windows
installed parallels 8 on it and windows 7 and windows 8 actually works excellent should i provoke some people and say that i find it works better than the mac os
o it has an extended battery life
and processor feels pressured even though i run medium scale programs watching the way exhaust speed increases
ive never had any problems with the computer itself the macbook charger chords are another story though
i am taking back today
also the speakers are not very loud but it is a netbook
it was delivered with 4gb of ram 2gb on each of two sticks which was probably adequate
this computer doesnt do that well with certain games it cant play some and it becomes too hot while playing games
easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printersheadsets
this is a great little computer for the price
i would definitely suggest this laptop
there are so many things wrong with this product it just makes me want to set my self on fire
the screen graphics and clarity and sharpness are great
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such a sophisticated computer
a coupla months later they change my hard drive
i hope they can fix it somehow
i did think it had a camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before i purchased
wifi card not working right out of the box
i love windows 7 which is a vast improvment over vista
i love the operating system and the preloaded software
i had been a windowslinux user before this
one drawback i wish the keys were backlit
microsoft support says to contact the manufacturerhp
they really know what they are doing
but let me tell you the mac book pro is so professional
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it
about 12 of the sites i need to visit because of my work contain some type of flash
but then again hindsight is 2020
the screen takes some getting use to because it is smaller than the laptop
then one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place
with a mac you dont have to worry about antivirus software or firewall its so wonderful
changed the memory from 4 gb to 8 gb corsair vengeance and 500 gb hdd 5400 rpm with seagate hybride 750 gb hddssd
im not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have a backlit keyboard and im getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge except i dont use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster
i can usually go about 10 hours before i get down to 10 battery life
it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot
the only thing i miss from my old laptop was the ability to be able to scroll down a page using the trackpad
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing i wonder if since i seem to be doubling the amount of time i get out of it each time its like new i might have 8 months next time
only had it a few weeks but doesnt leave my side
i spend so much time waiting for it
i purchased it through amazon
my laptop was easy to setup and ive had no problems to date
overall a solid laptop for its price
im excited for el capitan
otherwise this is a great computer great prices
cons 1 web cam
but after using it a couple of weeks the overall operation is poor
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and shed recommend it to anyone else looking for a netbook
it also gave me an introduction to windows 8 which i hope will be discontinued it the future
buy this if you like being tortured teased frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old mac
he cant stand it
i am taking the computer to apple to see what they think
i absolutely love my dell inspiron
you are getting what you pay for and in my opinion it is worth more
first when i move the screen to put it in tablet position the hinge doesnt seem totally solid
i was told by many that it was a great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad
it hangs freezes and just isnt working properly
you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it
i am not happy at all with the product i purchased
if anyone can help me out on this that would be great
i love love loooove
i dislike the weight and size cubersome
guess ill stay away from hp
the screen is bright and the keyboard is nice
i wanted something that had a new intel core processors and hdmi port so that we could hook it up directly to our tv
so you might ask what did apple do for me
the case is made from cheap plastic
even the sound is fantastic
just a click and a black screen
this is a great laptop
however a few things are immediately occurring to me i had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead
in due course ill remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash
the fact that the screen is fairly lowres for the price mbp 13 has a res of 1280x800 while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price really detracts from my personal experience with the computer
but sony doesnt seem to have addressed it
great battery life
i would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful
this has much more memory and ram memory
literally it stays much cooler than my old macbook pro
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed
got the computer back a month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it
apparently wellbuilt and gorgeous to look at the i5 macbook pro is a winning combination of price and performance
i would recommend it for anybody needing a reliable simple laptop
it started out getting hot after only a few months
the feature are good enough for what i need
positives no matter what position this laptop will stay in it
most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build
the machine is easy to use has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work
all in all its well worth its price tag
when the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself
that is my only complaint
macs hardly ever get viruses and they are completely incompatible with existing microsoft windows viruses
the touchpad is very intuitive so much so that i never want to use buttons to click again
by the way it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what i had just listed
i bought it for college and couldnt be happier
the repairs were made quickly though i must say however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me
it doesnt have a lot of frills but i didnt need any and being able to buy what i needed and not more than i needed was very important
i had been in a training program and had only used word on it
several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now i can understand why this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop weve ever owned
love the stability of the mac software and operating system
the display is awesome
im looking forward to needing a laptop update so i can purchase this computer again
if you are looking for a good laptop this is not it
in short i would never buy a compaq again
i bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and i am highlydissatisfied with it
it is fast booting up shutting down and connection with the internet
the waterfly cases are very good
im stuck w a broken computer
it can run games really well
windows 7 rocks
i love it
as a computer science student in college i find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more
i purchased a seagate solid state harddrive the same kind that apple installs originally
i wanted an entry level gaming laptop something with a discrete graphic card but i wasnt looking for a gaming desktop replacement
its also very energy efficient running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 watt lightbulb
my grand daughter attends kent state university
as a lifelong windows user i was extremely pleased to make the change to mac
that is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible
i bought a hp pavilion dv41222nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer
in two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the cd drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces
now i lay a pillow on my lap first
still testing the battery life as i thought it would be better but am very happy with the upgrade
okay lets just start out by saying i am in no way a computer techy
operating a non touch screen on this system is a royal pain
it has the latest i7 cpu with a gtx 950m for gpu which makes this laptop blazing fast boots up in under 5 seconds with the help of the ssd of course
it is very slow and not responsive
i love the easy to see screen and it works well for work persoal or just play
i bought this last week and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touchmouse stopped responding
price is great wish it didnt have windows 8 but that is an opinion
next time i am going back to apple
the webcam is nothing special its there if you need it
they did not replace the motherboard
if you want a computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video this computer is not for you
this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more
another satisfied customer
when you get a new toy you always want to use it right away
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing
this little netboook is helping me get work done
most laptops and notebooks are difficult to key on
ive had my lenovo for a little over a month now and it does everything i want it to do and more
the reviews at the time in late july 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review
this laptop does not have an rj45 ethernet adapter for wired network connection
the big deal with this was windows 7
maybe im not being reasonable but i dont feel thats the same as a new computer because i didnt pay for a refurbished computer
to install the software simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files
the battery doesnt last long but im sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem
i just cant fathom that the celebrated dell would last a week in environment of free competition with normal products it only survives bc its substandard laptops are forced onto captive students and employees through questionraising programs
amazing computer perfect for school
love the computer
i wanted a laptop on a budget just for my university teaching needs making word documents powerpoints excels pdfs office is not included
i have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet
the product is average and works well
while the keyboard itself is alright the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons
i had my iworks itunes email ms office network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour
this did give some set trouble and i had to call tech support
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move
very good price
i am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the mac
nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents
i really enjoy having all of the extra space especially coming from a laptop with only 500gb of hard drive space
from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer
general a quality laptop
i have had dell desktops for years so had no qualms about buying a dell laptop
i actually contact toshiba before i started having problem and was given run around after i supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired
i spoke to 4 different people and was told they needed to transfer me to a 5th person
i am stuck with a laptop that i cannot do very much with
they are so realistic i am just speechless
negatives as aforementioned my only con was the updates
i called back to ensure that received it they had
the harddrive crashed and i thought i had lost the whole computer
i own a hewlett packard laptop and ive had man problems with it since i bought in in feb 201
because it is a touch screen you dont even need a mouse
all i can say is wow
my kids have to take their pcs in once a year to have them debugged
i had to pay for the shipping
i work on a pc at home and have used pc all through college
hard drives can be replaced ram can be added as needed and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge
one of the primary reasons why i purchased an ipad was to store photographs so that i could show to my customers
plus you get 500gb which is also a great feature
a disk drive with buttons on it
i proceeded to make all updates for sony vaio including the bios
had to call dell to get it back online
the toshiba satellite laptop is designed to fail
how does the power supply not work
love this laptop wonderful price for what you get
for a time he used both now he uses his mac exclusively
probably as good as you can get in a netbook does everything i ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses
my dad has one of the very first toshibas ever made yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet
no hardware issues as is common with any apple product
now i have to contact asus and hope that they can fix it
i have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me
the screen is huge and coloful but no led backlighting
i run dreamweaver final cut pro 7 photoshop safari firefox msn messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy a better laptop
it looks sleek and gorgeous
its perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc
if you buy pray you dont have major prolems
this computer periodically crashes office iphoto safari
the display has a great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print
its extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive who uses those anymore anyways so it easily fits into any college students bag
from the build quality to the performance everything about it has been subpar from what i would have expected from apple
the acer one compuer is a great computer
as it turns out i just didnt know any better
i was a long time pc user
also when you try to download a large file like a video it will start out normally downloading at around 600kbsec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kbsec making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless
so we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didnt work
if you dont like fingerprints this might not be the laptop for you
bought this gateway m50 or 150 early 2007
it does what it advertises
good for every day computing and web browsing
the screen is great i dont see the need for a retina display
i think that anyone looking for a good durrable laptop then this is the way to go
a key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect
you cant get a virus on mac so in the long run the cost of the mac is saved by not buying security and not having to replace your computer every year or two
no complaints with their desktop and maybe because it just sits on your desktop and you dont carry it around which could jar the hard drive or the motherboard
over all very good system and worth it
most system now a days have something great but miss something that you will be looking for
as well as having the plug in the computer come loose
the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual but substantive
i did upgrade my old pc to windows 7 but i went with a macbook pro and i am very happy
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and its speed
i was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing i took it for granted that these features were standard
it doesnt get heated up much even after continuous usage
it had most of the features and all of the power that i wanted to replace my desktop machine
but every six months my dell computer crashes
the screen shows great colors
had to return the computer
pros o it usually runs very smoothly but apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers
needed a 2 usb adapt for network plug no problem
this laptop suits my needs as i am currently studying online and just need a computer for that purpose
was not aware it did not have a disk drive when i bought it or i would not of purchased it
i feel like my old laptop is a total price of crap now
i really like the mac 154in notebook but its very pricey
i have had another mac but it got slow due to an older operating system
i love this laptop
no lenovo for me
considered macbook air also before buying this pro but glad bought the pro because i didnt fancy carrying a bunch of adapters separate dvd player etc
if you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core amd or intel processor
if you are afraid of it not having a disc player please dont be
this machine is flawless fast and classy
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something id stare at for the entire 1011 hours of battery life five days a week
my son saw this laptop online and told be about it and i thought it was a good deal and bought it
this is a big disappointment
dells are ok hps arent that good but macs or fantastic
my macbook pro is no exception
hp was no help
it dosnt even have a disc compartment
i have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models
wonder its hard to get getting sold on a higher price in amazon
only issue is that it is a little slow and im fixing that by adding more ram
this aint it
battery is lasting about 6 hours as i am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos
thinking about returning it
doesnt have touch screen but i have a tablet so that wasnt so important
way to go and enjoy both worlds
i have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute
i swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one
s l o w reallllyy slow
the board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues
all the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from a thinkpad
happy buying
it gets the job done in terms of having a computer that can browse the web use wordexcel and the like
this is what i was looking for
i had a usb connect but i cant use it because it is not compatible
the mid2014 macbook pro does no disappoint
i should have sent it back to them then
signed not impressed
i use it for basic web browsing and word processing
the new mac os mountain lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad
didnt expect to repair it at once
its more like a snail crawl
if your looking to be a trendy hipster who cant live without a mac its a great buy
great laptop for the price works well with action pack games
i will never have a windows laptop again
count me as extremely satisfied its a perfect computer
they gave me a hard time yet again but their was a malfunction in the battery itself it didnt die
this is the third macbook pro in our family
now that i have it i see that i really needed this for much more
like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do very userfriendly
just wifi
looked up the manual on another computer
and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse
the 81 windows is a major disappointment
the pro is a great product i wish that the 13 inch models came with the intel i processors and had a more comfortable edge the edges hurt my wrists
im tired of the inept service
it is slow and complicated and very disappointing
its like 9 punds but if you can look past it its great
but to be honest i dont use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming
this laptop is a complete cheap junk
strong performance in this device makes use of fun and a strong sense of the era of speed
it is easy to use its keyboard easily accommodates large hands and its weight is fantasic
internet is fast and reliable battery life lasts a long time
this was the second computer and brand bought that day
i dont like windows 8 but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar
for my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin it happened 7 months ago they offered me an itouch 8gig you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich offer a loyal customer like me a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this
the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile
the mouse pad however is very loud which is why i gave it four stars
the price for the ram is about 80 so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new macbook
in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced
with my pc understanding how to jump through hoops is important
i wont ever buy a computer off amazon again thats for sure
it works fine with our wireless and theyve had not problems
the screen is a matte 1080p display which is nice but with poor viewing angle
practice i guess
if a website ever freezes which is rare its really easy to force quit
like seriously really slow
do you remember when computers didnt have cameras on them
needless to say i told them no and have a nice day and hung up
i sent this to a colleague after configuring it with the apps i wrote
i loaded windows 7 via bootcamp and it works flawlessly
the home pagestartup is easy to navigate which is the one thing i was mainly concerned about
id recommend this laptop to anyone
summary they played games with me for the warranty period
i highly recommend
the most disappointing purchase of my life
would be a very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly
love the color accuracy
the space bar sticks
you will regret it if you buy any dell
excellent buy
great price
needs more instructions with it
the ssd and i7 complement each other really well
the only drawback is no dvd player but for 20 you can buy an external one
c a large hard drive instead of using the cloud
the only thing is that the battery wont last more than 12 an hour
the screen resolution is crystal clear the speakers are amazing and the track pad is easy to use
it stopped working 31 days after purchase
when i got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with a droid i have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port
the newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick but it is still a great notebook
i will give advise any prospective buyers this is not great laptop its good for web browsing and word processing
its so bad that im thinking i only got half a battery or something
the macbook rarely requires a hard reboot
users switching from a pc will definitely prefer itunes to microsofts windows media player
has a built in camera which i do not use
i have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good
i dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing
kind of annoying but i still love the laptop
a cheaper price should not equal a cheap product
i dont have that additional money right now and therefore wouldnt have purchased it at this time
battery doesnt last long web browsing 25 hours maybe
keyboard could use some trimming
i am a college student and it has been very useful
money and time well spent
the resolution is gorgeous the computer is light it does everything i need and the interface is pretty intuitive
it is exactly what i expected and the price is excellent
well see
this is a great computer
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too
it has a wide screen and its easy to use
when i got this laptop in 2007 to help me with school i had a hard time from beginning
while most people say that pcs hold functionality and value and macs are just pretty to look at i think theres something to be said about the simplicity of macs
sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while i get my money back for a defective product
so im cooled on mac buys
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue
i have only had pcs with windows before so this takes a little getting use to
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key
terribly slow
so beware buyer this computer has a useless piece of plastic on it
i can use it as a tabletas a laptop as whatever i want to
if you like your windows 7 vista or even xp just stick with it
really at this point i am trying to confirm if the ram can be upgraded to see if i can do that to help
bought this laptop from best buy in january 2015 still loving it
also the extended warranty was a problem
i really wish i had done this years ago
but remember you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software which is a joy to work with considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious pc users
this is starting off good
ive had my macbook pro since august 2009
too often i would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet
if this is an improvement in customer service then i would hate too see what it was before
i would rate this computer at 5 stars but considering it has a short life span i can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine
macs are amazing
never had any issues no frustrations just great easy wireless all in one fun
i have used pcs and converting to this macbook pro was easy
after working on windows laptop and pc over 15 years i decided to try this apple laptop
i can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well
i currently own a apple desktop which is usually used to watch movies in my studio
feels like solid state
but i would recommend this product
they loved it
update after the hassle of a return waiting in line then sitting around the store to allow the computer and keyboard to charge sufficiently i was able to obtain a keyboard which was paired out of the box with the computer
i love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky
this laptop is the best of the best
the glare of the glossyretina display is unbearable
i tried giving it 0 stars but i had to choose at least one but imo no stars
remember to do your research first before consider buying a toshiba product
i can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly
the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled
i wouldve given 5 stars had it not been for the hours of updates ive had to do to this upon arrival
so i called customer support and the man asked for the serial number
firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing
i work with kids and they love making short videos on there
its software and speed enable it to do amazing things
the power chord is a little short compared to most laptops
the applications are also very easy to find and maneuver much easier than any other computer i have ever owned
they are fine while the free subscription is going but a pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login
i have had several machines over the years both for personal and business use
it is easy to operate and i have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops
the graphics are stunning
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff i dont want it too
they would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem
its fast its easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network
i know there are way better laptops out there for the same price and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls
no tutorials on the display
other than that i dont have one complaint in the world
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have
o others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for for example engineering majors need extra applications amp systems to do some work but they are easily downloadable
i doi9ng fine now and happy as a bug
i dont have the inclination or time to devote to a companies tech support search functions or hold timesdropped the hp and never looked back
if you are looking for something reliable this is the laptop for you
i would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase
the quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me
i received this laptop as a gift and let me just tell you that its the worst
for the price and what i get out of it has exceeded my expectations
i would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express
6 no cd drive
now the screen is going darker darker darker
the pictures are clear as can be
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs
would not recommend
also wish it had a port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work
i could see the disk drive on the side but it didnt seem to have a button on it
i am loving it completely
its light and easy to use though
conshonestly zero cons as a windows pc user the switch over was seamlessly i run parallel when i need windows
its ok
there is nothing to complain about the system
what can i say
i burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so i can place it there
power on good luck finding it
the track pad to me is what really stands out though you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad awesome thinking apple
after a little more than a year of owning my macbook pro the monitor has completely died
it wouldnt fit in most 17inch bags
this computer had exactly the specifications i needed
the so called laptop runs to slow and i hate it
it has met all my needs
have the unit serviced
after doing cad work all day at work using a higher end pc i couldnt come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer
its 156 inches which for me is not too big nor too small
by just looking at it you will realize its crap
the laptop itself is very good it could be better but not bad at all for its price point
love the speed especially
there is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle and when i click on it it says consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge
it is the easiest computer i have ever used
with todays company fighting over marketshare its a shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone
the laptop has 4g and a 29g processor and its slower than the four year old toshiba i replaced
it has everything i wanted built in wifi connectibility a slot for my sd camera memory card a dvd burner big beautiful screen plenty of usb ports three 30 and one 20 and a keyboard with a nice touch
after 4 days being denied 6 times and told off once i managed to get through and was able to send them a scanned copy of the receipt
i had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity because it is very sensitive
it immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace
then after paying for it to be examined i was told it was same problem cited on website but id have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and i am not kidding you i called different hours of the day and youll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they dont have your history list of your calls right in front of them
it is amazing
the one thing i wish it had was a detailed hardcopy manuel
i would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing i really care about
his reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said make sure you have your facts straight before you smear
2 keyboard is great
i love this product because it is toshiba and its 156
features like the font are very blocklike and old school
after they found no other way they told me to courier it to themsince they dont allow the use of the post office at my expense and sent me a 4 page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldnt be covered
i have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open
by air sounds more like by truck to me
get speck cover at the same time
the only thing i use this computer for is a safari tester and safari is awful compared to chrome
im hoping that i can find a really quick way to clean it without it getting too gross
i have had macbook pros and macbook airs and have never had a problem
purchased it for my birthday and love it
i built my own gaming pc with a intel i54590 in it and a gtx 760 so i know what crazy performance on a computer can come to
but with a way bigger screen and is able to connect to an hdmi
love the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great but a little bit of a learning curve there too as sometimes i have to tap a few times to get the exact location i need
i love ths notebook
the awesomest of the awesomest
my son and his family have a hard time financially because he is selfemployed so the family had no computer of any kind and kyle the oldest child is 12 and really need something to help him in school
i feel that enough people have macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be
i bought it for my parents late 60s and they love it particularly the keyboard and screen
i had to decide if i was going to make a financial commitment to windows upgrade buy new change
for the price this is a super product out of the box
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working 3 months of use which was frustrating
im excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same
i had delusions of grandeur regarding apples amp34great customer serviceamp34 and the amp34reliability of their machinesamp34 etc etcblahblah
awesome price for a laptop that lasts more than 8 hours without recharging
by the wayi paid for this particular laptop roughly 2 grandlook at the price now
i am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one
i do transcription work on the side and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well
crashed only 2 days from getting it
there are also many carrying cases to purchase to have extra protection
i did contact hp and share how unhappy i am
so long story short if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop
the computer is so slow even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up
this is a horrible laptop
musicvideos sound great and look great
if its not shipped on the next business day called on a friday they are closed on weekends what was the next step
this is a fantastic transformer
was searching online for a power supply when i found this site
the battery life is a joke and its causing other problems
i feel like i need to be really gentle with it but maybe thats just me
i may give it one more shot tonight then im returning it to the vendor
the brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light
it still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there
and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free
i am a freelance graphic artist
the glass track pad is large enough for apples highly acclaimed multitouch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers
it absolutely is more expensive than most pc laptops but the ease of use security and minimal problems that have arisen make it well worth the pricetag
what a lemon
it is very easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted
everything at a very great price
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with
sounds like a typewriter but if you can get past that this is a great laptop for a little money
runs smooth and quick
the first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours
windows 8 is not supported by a lot of things
overall good but processing power isnt very good
i would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter
and if you are a game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully
1st time they got it working the next 5 month they had me send it in
i will be considering lenovo for all future laptop purchases
in upgrading to this computer i can say i have found little to any flaws in the product hence the 5 star review
d was under 300 with shipping
the lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if youre not interested in it
it does come with two usb 20 ports a hdmi port and a webcam
the touchscreen and 2in1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes
the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution
the price is great and it does everything i want to do thanks
this is something i would deffinately reccomend to someone
great quick laptop for the money
if your time is worth anything to you if you are tired of rebooting reformatting reinstalling trying to find drivers if you want a computer to work for you for a change make the change to this computer
could lose another pound or two
i sent it to them to fix in perfect condition but for what was wrong with it
it flickers briefly to green before the light goes out
things just work they are fluid easy to use and understand fast and work well
before i bought my new i5 i did my research for about 2 weeks and determined to move for hp to apple for reliability dependable and long lasting operations
it is much faster than my desktop which is a core2 quad running at 283 ghz
this is my first mac
the design is awesome quality is unprecedented
i dont understand why only windows 7 starter is included
i should have bought something better
the sound is disappointing
heavy gaming is definitely not its strong point
i got the blue screen of death the first month i got it
the toshiba mini notebook model nb 305n410bl is a great little computer
there is a blank lighted screen when i start and that is all
overall build quality is cheap
my friends are in awe every time they come over
so frustrating
i purchased a toshiba satellite m60 with harmankardon speakers in december of 2005
i dont have to pay extra for what i hate i mean seriously who types with their laptops and occasionally reaches out to the screen to tap it
the hdd has a scratching noise
there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it
im really frustrated by this experience
sound quality and touchscreen are awesome
i have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem
the only bad part is the sizeweight
i have had to call with a few questions or issues and they have helped me for free even without the warranty
ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on
screen is crystal clear yes its small but its a netbook
im so glad i purchased a mac and not another pc
i spoke with a service rep at micro center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter so its not just an isolated incident
one of the worst pieces of electronics i have ever bought
i was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that i was looking for
i am addicted to photo booth
it is a little sluggish which was to be expected with the 4gb ram but even at its sluggish it is faster than the pc i bought
i was torn between this laptop and the zenbook
fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking a timed test
for windows users switching to a mac you can also enable right clicking known to apple as secondary click in the system preferencesgt mouse and enabling right clicking
it does have a habit of restarting itself when you try to do the log in pw but over all im very satisfied
this computer is like im lost for words
it is a cheap throw together
awesome laptop for college
the two of us use it regularly
bought with a credit card
5 and this has a extra slot for hdd
please people dont make the same mistake i did
i would highly recommend this one to my friends
dell support was awful to deal with
when i attach a mouse its fine but the touchpad is really annoying
to be honest i am a little disappointed and considering returning it
none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing
dont expect much in terms of performance from this laptop
it has 3 usb ports 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion
i would tell the technician i knewexactlywhat was wrong with it but they did not listen and i had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me i needed to send the computer in
since ive had this computer ive only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth
couldnt not use it
they are not
little short on ram but you get what you pay for
i didnt have that much money so i thought id give the inspiron a try
says it is failing hard drive
hp said it was out of warranty
i called their repair depot as was told they would send me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot
i tell everyone i see out looking to get this or another toshiba
my iphone synced right up just like a person would expect unlike the pcs in our lives
i dont really have a complaint
overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop the mouse was the only negative i could really see
great for games
was easy to set up and has been easy to learn to use it
i didnt want to buy a generic brand computer but it is really nice
i cant believe people like these computers
i thought learning the mac os would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a pc
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing
i bought my macbook pro in october of 2012 and 2 years later it still works as flawless as ever
kinda to light and plastic feeling
also the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear and everything is just sleek and smooth
i just bought this computer from the apple store and i couldnt be more impressed with it
i could go on and on but suffice it to say if you want to spend 400 on a laptop dont buy this one
the first programm i switched on was a game for my children
this one doesnt seem to be the same quality as ones i have purchased before
not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs
the internet speed is spectacular
it has got me feel like to take years to successfully open a web page
its solid
amazing machine
but for the price its good
since i purchased my toshiba netbook i have been very pleased with it i have a laptob and a desktop
sorry toshiba but 1st impressions do count for something
the touchpad is extremely sensitive which is the only drawback
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done
i usually use my mac for school work and internet browsing so the entrylevel 13 macbook pro is already more than what i expected from a computer i would typically use it for
has a 56 hour battery life
did not disappoint me at all
fast fast and fast the web pages just fly by
however this laptop far exceeded my expectations when i bought it for college i only use malwarebytes and microsoft security essentials run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years
most windows laptops have 2 to 4 or more
one of the smartest thing i did was take my time to compare laptops before making my purchase
i have never been to a genius bar since my first purchase 1984
i took it back to the store and exchanged it for another one
slick design and looks great
computer was doa
i will only buy apple laptops from now on
users without an optical drive can skip the installation of microsoft office and head to the next section
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it
very happy with my 7th toshiba laptop
the feel of this machine compared to the old macbook is far superior
everything about a mac is wonderful it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system but you will learn fast and its all worth it
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie internet tabs programs etc simultaneously
well i have to say since i bought my mac i wont ever go back to any windows
if you want to use the internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon
i purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email
it would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and i would be up hoursjust because the computer was too slow
5best to use the power supply for 4k video viewing
its clunky heavy and a pain to start up and shut down
plain and simple itlaptop runs great and loads fast
i highly recommend you get one before they are gone
pretty premium feel for the low price
it also came with a built it web cam which is great because i can see an communicate with my family members back home
i only have two complaints
a tip for people looking into this computer do not buy it save up a bit more money and buy a computer that will last
price was higher when purchased on mac when compared to price showing on pc when i bought this product
4 build solid and durable
w7 pro with w8 pro upgrade is nice but it frequently freezes for a few seconds here and there
i always have used a tower home pc and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance
the only reason i didnt give it a 5 star is i feel i have to reach so far to type on the key board
the only thing that i dont like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that i want to be able to run and i am not able to
the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide
i look forward to years of use it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well
this is my first apple laptop
and the settings are simply annoying
before and after i resolved that issue i saw the damn beachball all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell its doing while i wait for it
i own a 13 air a 15 macbook pro both prior generations
this computer is great
i like everything about this laptop
the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal
waiting for the i7 was well worth it great value for the price
been using lenovo thinkpad edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them
its a great laptop but right now its annoying to use the touchpad
theyre easy fun powerful and will last a long time
however the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more
in addition to some usage on the road this is also my desktop unit
the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product
im glad to have it and it showed up in only a few days
do not recommend
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking
of course i also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie
battery life needs more life
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touchpad making the touchpad hard to use when using headphonesmic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person
overall this is a fast light practical computer and i highly recommend it
i have been a mac person since 1984
this is how i feel about the laptop so far
i had cloned my data from my old computer using carbon copy cloner ccc and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds i had only dreamed up before
this is one of the reasons i purchased it
it gives me everything i need from a computer and with the long lasting battery it also gives me mobility
frustrated i hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 23 days for turnaround time
ive been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory
that is how it is able to function better than any other pc
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard
but other then that i would give this product a 4 in hafe stars
2nd best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into
what is there not to like
i like the number pad for work so thats nice
i still use my desktop for the high end stuff but this laptop handles everything else very well
i paid about 18000 for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me
also after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises
outstanding laptop and very well built
the second one after a little over a month refused to turn on even with a full charge
just not for me
so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop
lenovo sent me a box to return it to them
but if you buy this i would highly recommend that you buy a case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile
not working bad
the only objection i have is that after you buy it the windows 7 system is a starter and charges for the upgrade
then just the other day my left mouse button snapped
im all for saving money but dell needs to step it up
the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly
love the flip feature and the touch screen feature
fast
its lightweight and easy to carry around
i myself had purchased the 750 gig drive laptop and as a dj with thousands of songs pictures and other thingsand after 3 years i have managed to fill around 9 of my gigs
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning
then within 5 months the charger crapped out on me
you might think i am new in this game but i am a gadget lover and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years and none gets this hot that fast
we have had our desktop for around four years
it has a lot of memory and a great battery life
only good thing is the graphics quality
i always swore by pcs and would never consider a mac
the computer first started malfunctioning 3 months after purchasing it
its catatonic
does all that was advertised
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed
plus stylish
the disks i made wouldnt workhp support stated quotwere a hardware company not a software companyquot
also i have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly
i would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one
for the use it was purchased for it is a good laptop
i also experience the same with my macbook air
the apple applications exiphoto are fun easy and really cool to use unlike the competition
toshiba is a great brand even though i havent had it for a long time i am very happy with it
this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases
i wanted a simple full hd display and this one does its job
so buyer beware when buying toshiba
i am experiencing the system little slower than what i have expected
my wife has had her macbook pro going on three years and i just purchaced my macbook pro this year
think i would spend little extra to get a better made laptop
i love the glass touchpad
the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers
biggest piece of junk i have ever purchased
of course this will decrease your battery life
love this computer
it was easy to set up
make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast
i didnt even know what that was until i got this
its wonderful for computer gaming
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me but i have just been using firefox instead
upgrading from windows 7 starter thru windows 7 home premium to windows 7 professional was a snap
if you shop around in the current market you can find a much better deal
i think this computer is super lame
the worst computer i have ever laid my eyes upon
i have used this product for only 2 days but i cant wait to use it more
needless to say a pc that cant support a cell phone is less than useless
the laptop is so easy to work with
bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a dell in the past which was a great computer
great product by apple with the new great looking design
dont expect it to be a champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you
i will be returning it
the only thing i would change about it is the mouse keys
it feels very well built
what a great laptop i can run my games and work really fast
the fact that you can spend over 100 on just a webcam underscores the value of this machine
ouch
apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products
now its unthinkable to buy a computer without one
and the only microphone input is for a combo mikespeaker plug
it was not responsive at all to touch
probbly the worst decision we ever made
turned it on and it was beeping
boot time is super fast around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork
the unibody design is edgy and durable
the graphics on this computer are also stellar very clear and vivid
the thunderbolt port is awesome
now the speed is disappointing
youll need to upgrade and pay a little more for them
the system sometimes lags a lot
i am very happy with this computer
i went through the settings and there isnt a way to fix it
it has no camera but i can always buy and install one easy
it is very well built
the time remaining goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes
it was time to replace my 8 year old laptop and i decided to get a amp34fancyamp34 mac book pro
i upgraded its ram to 2gb i am very happy with it
this was purchased for my daughter and i was pleasantly surprised
i use my mac all the time i love the software the way it takes a short time to load things how easy it is to use and most of all how you dont have to worry about viruses
this is perfect for her field
so with this new order all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and i got this for the long haul
i have used a computer at work but having your own personal laptop is awsome
being only 2 months old i am not a happy camper
i homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping a beat
thanks macconnection for making this a seamless purchase
and toshiba is a quality supplier
fantastic for the price just wish it the keys were illuminated
i love the apple products
im very happythis laptop is beatifull isnt slow at all
i will stack it up against laptops that cost twice as much any day
this computer is a fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life
the battery is really long
id much rather bite the bullet and spend a little more for a product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for 2014
great for web design and general work
i regretted immediately
im not playing the game of send in a computer or wait for a new keyboard while my return window is still open
apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality
well she was right whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever
my favorite colors black and red the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard
a bit uglybut works good
plus this computer comes with a full size keyboard
it looks and feels solid with a flawless finish
perfect size for me
you will not regret buying such a great thing like this
the only thing i have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which i would have liked to do though amp34home sharingamp34 i used itunes on a computer separate from my linux computer but i could not figure that out
this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny
i didnt think i would need an optical drive but since i have had it i used it several times
i dont know how i could ever live without my qousmio
so far i have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future
im very happy with my acer it does just for what i need it
my bud had the same problem
i agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is a con in my opinion
it still serves me well both in business and home needs
dont try to use to play any pc games or anything
i have vista so i am unable to install and uninstall some programs
it does make a little noise but thats alright as its not too much
so you dont get frustrated the first few weeks
dont waste your money
we are addicted to the mac
my dad bought this for me as a birthday gift at the university of utah book store
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me a box and two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air to louisville ky
those things are very important vital even
thankfully i have earphones and an external amplifier for audio the onboard speakers are just terrible
been using it for about 4 hours now and it seems plenty fast and does everything i need it to do
it was stubborn as hell no amount of dust or slipping to the ground phased it
if you are looking to get a 2in1 laptop this is the laptop you should consider
even the battery life is like wow
i have not used my ipad since my mac purchase
this is my 3rd apple laptop and first macbook pro
the only downside are the speakers
i am impressed with this computer inexpensive but quality
im overall very pleased with my new laptop
i hope my customer review has been useful feel free to respond with opinions or feedback about the content of my review
this mbp is clean neat and simple
the solidstate memory makes it a lot faster than previous macbook pro models that used a spinning hard drive
it was slow locked up and also had hardware replaced after only 2 months
it does everything i need it too
i mainly use it for email internet and managing personal files pics vids etc
they ended up not charging me
pairing it with an iphone is a pure pleasure talk about painless syncing used to take me forever now its a snap
eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on
nice and light seems to help your work instead of becoming work itself
it is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything i was looking for
this is definitely a computer worth the money
great battery speed display
this clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered
its been easy breezy since then
enough said
even though i had the receipt in front of me proving it still had 2 months left on the warranty
laptop is advertised as a 15 but the casing looks like that of a 17
my parents bought it for me as a graduation gift and im totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable
i was disappointed when i realized that the keyboard doesnt light up on this model
my one complaint with this laptop is that ive noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in
10 hours of battery life is really something else
great product very easy to use and great graphics
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features
so i looked in the manual and what do i find
for those without an optical drive mbp with retina display and mb air read this
the mouse is way way way to sensitve
it is by far one of the greatest investments i have ever made
probably not a gaming machine which i have zero interest in
the ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it
do not buy it
works beautifully
the os is easy and offers all kinds of surprises
cant even read properly
but as time went on i found it almost impossible to keep the thing online through wifi
im glad i made the choice to switch and buy this mac
i just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks
so far so good i have not encountered any issues with this computer
2very decent speakers
his language was so bad i swore i was taking the turing test and it was failing
now they are believers in the product
overall a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer
i believe this macbook pro was a lemon right out the gate
excellent value and a must buy for someone looking for a macbook
its also fun to use
my real problem with it
the a key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldnt press in
iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites
when i called toshiba they would not do anything and even tried to charge me 35 for the phone call even though they didnt offer any technical support
works very well
users with and optical drive can skip this section
the screen is framed by half to a fullinch margin that is obviously unnecessary reduces the screen size and increases the bulk
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer was a six month trial
the screen has an extremely high resolution that im very pleased with
bootup time is amazing battery life is decent and it has a great slim form factor
i would buy one of these for every person in my office if i could
this is the first laptop ive owned althougth i used several at my previous job
oh my goodnessi am not a happy camper
my first problem was with the preloaded norton firewallsecurity program
long story short since i experience so many problems with my laptop every since i bought it from day one i didnt ask for a new laptop or a refund of what i pay for a crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in
also the battery does not last very long at all
i like the laptop overall
ive been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is a gem
we havent used it enough or had it long enough to give it 5 stars but so far it has been a very good laptop
lightweight and the screen is beautiful
me and my boyfriend bought the gateway nv78 in nov of 09
very poor quality lap top
i bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it
disc drive will not open or function
thinking i received the laptop with a faulty touchpad driver installed
this is the first macbook i have ever had
2nd mac book i have purchased from macconnection
i can run somewhat modern games like skyrim and fallout new vegas with no issues
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small
i especially like the backlit keyboard
i asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple doesnt consider the product defective
any of those are way simpler to use than apples mountain lion operating system
i came from the dell laptops and now i am so glad i switched when i needed a new laptop
i am very happy i bought this mac well worth the extra money
cons o some people dont enjoy the way the processing system runs but dont have any issues with getting it to function
finally was able to reach a young lady in california and ordered the machine and was subsequently given a delivery date
if youre looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphicsintensive game youd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market
i had to pay 100 for a universal charger for this cheap 300 laptop
mine came at 1700 wo a dvd burner
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and i would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them
it has a decent feel to it sharp display and is fast enough
just look at a market share between the two concepts
i purchased this laptop 9 months ago
excellent item shipped on time met my expectations it doesnt heat at all dont use it for gaming
web access through the 3g network is so slow its very frustrating and very disappointing
i have owned many computers and laptops
i realize that not every unit has this issue but the ones that do cannot be repaired
i am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop
in the three years ive had my macbook pro i have never had a virus on my computer and i do a lot of work on the internet
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay 175 to fix it we were like we will just by a portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the 175 and it was fixed
i visited the apple store and was impressed with the 17inch macbook pro
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts
no one would ever answer my question as to why i couldnt get another new macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my macbook was still under warranty
this is what a laptop is supposed to be
this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing
the letter a stopped working after the first week
i love its solid build light wt and excellent battery life for now
it works exactly like it did the day i took it out of the box
i plan on using my macbook pro for a long time
might not make the avid gamer happy but i dont really think that is what this computer is designed for
the wheel that turns the volume up and down doesnt work in real time
glad i did so far
nothing like the description says
the laptop is fast
my sister has the same mac as me and she is in a band and uses garageband to record and edit
i would recommend this to anyone who doesnt need much out of a computer
glad it has the dvd drive
screen is clear and bright
are u serious
im learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages
awesome laptop
i had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty
only 2 usb ports
very fast and efficient
i now travel with this laptop and my work pc
a good value for the money
but it works really slowwwwww
hmmm that high failure rate sure isnt reflected in the retail price
i also got the added bonus of a 30 hd monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh
be sure the programs you need will work on a mac before you buy one
the processor shows a speed of 17gz
the only reason i returned it was because i bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate
i wish i had bought this sooner
ive always owned a pc and decided to try a macbook to see what its all about
the statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration its a lie
i have a lot of antiquated programs that i use that require a download
it is easily portable and i take it everywhere i go and might require internet access
thank you amazon
excellent performance especially given its price point
yet hp wont do anything about the problem
it runs faster than it did when i got it
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it iphoto imovie iweb itunes garageband is all very helpful as well
it mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you dont need
ive havent had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off
i promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine
the mouse on the pad the left button always sticks
price makes this the laptop i was looking for
i just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and i wont have to worry about a crash
the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy and i can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer which is also a mac
2 sometimes when i stared mine up it would take a few extra minutes to boot on other times it is a few seconds
it drives me crazy when i want to download a game or something of that nature and i cant play it because its not compatable with the software
for a premium laptop sold in 2013 the apple macbook pro 13 inch base model is about as basic as it gets no ssd no discrete graphics no 1080p display and no touch screen
i wish it had a webcam though then it would be perfect
i lost two items i was working on until i figured out what was happening
i have square trade for it just in case it breaks
mac is complicated and frustrating at moments
size is perfect and display is beautiful
i challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 25 hrs out of it
consumer report recommended toshiba
look and feel is good
the performance is awesome
one of the very few laptops still available with win 7 pro multiple usb ports and a dvd readwrite drive
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer
ive had the macbook pro 15 for about three weeks and it really is a great computer
i replaced stock drive with wd black 7k drive and is still quite slow
for example when my husband turns the light out while im on the computer the screen brightness automatically adjusts
i just bought 3rd gen ipad to add to my collection
its a good laptop for its value
i love the new high retina display and because this computer lacks a disc player it makes it significantly lighter
the magnetic plugin power charging power cord is great i even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation
my macbook pro has been a huge disappointment
i was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with a no issues whatsoever
very good quality and well made
im very pleased with the purchase
however there is some learning curve but once you get through it you will admire this product which is expensive compare to windows laptop
this is my first dell i heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it
it is not even a year old yet so i woulddefinitely not recommend it to anyone
iv spent as much for shipping as i would to buy a new netbook of course a different brand
currently if i use the laptop i cant sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs
i had a great experience purchasing my dell inspiron i35311200bk 156inch laptop
very light and beautiful
otherwise i love it
its replacing a first generation surface pro that is too bulky and heavy to effectively use my preference
i purchased a dell inspiron i35311200bk and so far i love it this model has a true life monitor which is worth the extra bucks
in those three years ive had a couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily
will update my review when i have time
its great for what he uses it for
wonderful machine
i immediately did the windows 10 upgrade and havent had any issues
crisp screen great battery life and plenty of storage
my macbook is probably the best investment i have ever made
so far i do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is a bit poor
it takes a long time to get on the web and to change web sites
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden
4 the fan kicks in even its not too hot
my laptops one of the key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure
i cant even install one of the 3 printers i have in my house so i am unable to print
its an amazing laptop
my brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an apple
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front
it doesnt bother me though
you will not regret buying this computer
it is a big big but since it has a 184 screen what would you expect
so far i havent lost any quality or information
it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop
everything i have tried has worked and i never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome
i like this machine because its very lightweight
it freezes and it always shows that there is an error so i have to restart it a few times every time i use it
two of the times was in one month
screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment
it is held in place magnetically
i bought my macbook a few months ago and it has been my baby ever since
no viruses
they have not sent a new one nor called
i paid about the same for my toshiba as i did for the compaq a few years back
hate windows 81
it is super easy to use
my first mac computer and as many before me i just fall in love with it
i am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great
i can provide a review from a laymans viewpoint
i am very pleased with my purchase
i let my friend borrow it and she knows nothing about computers and she used it with ease
but at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem
this was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped
im sure most peoples macbooks work just fine but fyi if you get the factory dud youre stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away
super light weight i never cared either way about weight until now
ive never had problems with viruses
i still see the benefits of a pc when i do not know how to do something on my mac
if youre looking for a basic pc this is the way to go
perfectly adequate
great product and couldnt be happier with it
i also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad
and with this price i dont think you can buy anything better
the hard drive crashed as well and i had to buy a new power cord
this a starter notebook
the quality engineering design and warranty are superiorcovers damage from dropping the laptop
overall it is a fantastic laptop
i took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and i finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty
when calling dell for help reurn or a new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it
it is the worst laptop ever
the only thing i can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time
they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer not what ive done
the batter lasts as long as claimed
also the touchpad is almost sticky which kind of defeats the purpose of a touchpad
as an owner of a toshiba satalite laptop computer things you should know before you buy
great pc
was very much worth the price i paid
seriously save yourself the hassle and purchase from a different company
awesome
the great 18 month same as cash financing and advance protection plan which includes accidents like spills which apple doesnt offer is why i bought my macbook at best buy
the computer is horrible its to slow
fan vents to the side so no cooling pad needed great feature
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country
it does everything i need
hope this helped
the difference is the toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space
all works beautifully but windows 8 is taking a bit of getting used to
i was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase
much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me
one suggestion i do have is to not bother getting microsoft office for the mac expecting it will work just like you knew it to on a pc
her final response was amp34whateveramp34
waiting to install ms office and see how it goes from there
now when i say dont expect to play games on it i mean it
this laptop broke within the first hour of use
im pleased
i cant believe this was just 250
i still cant pair it
my first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also brilliant
now the machine wont connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for 30 days and now im out of warranty even though this has been a constant 5 month occurance since i bought the netbook
be aware of price differences when purchasing computer
also the display is exceptional
do not buy a mac until this issue is resolved
i wanted to love this laptop which i bought as a transitional laptop to use between jobs before my new university gave me one
another great thing is the beast graphics
btw i have far fewer security hack issues too
nuff said
the processor is very quick and effective as i load webpages and applications
has met or exceeded my needs for a compact travel device
con hate that it has no disk drive
the sound is very nice and crisp
have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed etc
just wish there were more usb ports
to my mind much more usable than the toy called an ipad
this unit is not
i cant imagine my life without it anymore
i especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear the keyboard and the fit just feels right
when i first got the computer i noticed the tracking pad was hard to click
save your money and get an android works better more support
the cords always feel like they are in my way
i droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and it is still working with no issues
i dont have any complains about this computer
3 cannot manually take battery out unless you work for apple or have the tools
ill rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba
i need graphic power to run my adobe creative apps efficiently
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke
the problem i had with this unit was unresolvable
the wifi is very weak
but after i got used to it i love it
great sound quality too
i love the size because the screen is big enough for what i use it for internet artwork and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable
i did not have to call the support line at all
screen is awesome battery life is good
it had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use and would not move past this error
i am a wife mom and a school teacher and a college student
a month or so ago the freaking motherboard just died
i wouldnt play a firstperson shooter with this mind but if you wanted to run ms office email chat download a video listen to music from a certain fruitnamed music store and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in id highly recommend checking this out
the only downfall is the volume control
my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net when i out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and i will be buying only toshiba
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything
laptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches 30
it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features
love the key layout and the builtin mouse pad all work well and are properly sized
all in all i wish i had waited a bit
upgrading from a toshiba laptop i am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides
small and light weight
but other than that i really am loving the quality and speed
its perfect
the touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus
i bought this netbook for traveling and its great light functional and meets my needs
5 i found the track pad not great
dell latitude d620 is not a reliable machine
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click
battery life is great though it is new
summary dont buy hp
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to
keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best
i bought this a few months ago and its holding up fairly well
i would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top performing laptop
returned it to walmart
machine is flying and with parallels desktop 8 i have my old pc notebook completely functional on my mbp
it wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at 249
being a pc user my whole life its taking a bit of time to adapt to the os of a mac but im finding my way around
if you dont like windows i would suggest trying a mac
its heavy
once in a long while that doesnt work in that case i turn the computer off then on again and sign in problem solved
this computer may be small but it is one heck of a power horse
it has come into good use for my finances scheduling my parents business expenses and it is definitely amazing for gaming
battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery
and toshiba is totally unconcerned
this laptop has delivered
the speakers are fairly basic so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies
my favorite computer ive ever had
they were great
i babyed the heck out of it and i still do
it was still working but there was nothing on the screen
i wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble
it has a stunning retina display and is very fast
most of my things are stored in the cloud
i bought this for my 9 year old for a birthday gift
with the eol of xp
call tech support standard email the form and fax it back in to us
it is very light and the picture is nice and the price was amazing
not easy to carry
well i started using google chrome which is a little better but it freezes too sometimes
this computer is the ideal college companion
and plenty of storage with 250 gbthough i will upgrade this and the ram
while it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive i do not feel like it is something i absolutely need
it is very durable i am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet
this laptop leaves alot to be desired i have had it only 5 months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice
the snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy
its a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them
please google macbook battery bulge explode before you buy your next apple toy
keyboard is great very quiet for all the typing that i do
one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual
i would highly recommend this computer it is fast
i am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop socarryingit around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it
it has worked fine
its also incredibly light has a battery that can last for days and looks like a piece of art
overall i am very satisfied with the purchase
it is easy to use and lightweight
i just love this lap top i just wish it were all silver or they had all black
they only stay charged a little over an hour
i have only used pcs in the past and its easy to see that apple is just more advanced
everything is so easy to use mac software is just so much simpler than microsoft software
i bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often
however it does not have a dvd drive neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external dvd drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive
its truly a great laptop for the price
since i also do a lot of writing and illustrations using adobe products i thought i would try a mac
the reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlledlighting environment like me i prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness
although its display is bright and vibrant the os so unusable for work i have moved back to the older and still over performing pc
lightweight long battery life excellent transition from pc
good keyboard long battery life largest hard drive and windows 7
bought it to use mostly for oline classes
i wasnt disappointed in its performance
will not every buy anotherlou
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch
my hp g60244dx died after only 16 months
i can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner
actually streams better than my regular desk top computer
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service
great wifi too
its worth it
the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you
then to make matters worst there is noone that they can transfer you to
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer
the toshiba laptop i am using is easier to use than most i have tried
i love to use it it is esay and light
it is well worth the money it cost very good investment
worth the investment and truly a fine piece of equipment
the machine has a bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv
for the same price you get a lot more in the asus1920x1080 res awesome cooling system much better grafics card ati 5870 8gb ram led backlit screen
i wish this company to go bust
not a good computer at all
i shopped around before buying
its a steal when considering the specs and performance as well
actually i think i was intimidated by the change from a pc
well my first apple computer and i am impressed
price and purpose is awesome
i dont like this company nor the toshiba brand and ill never buy another one because ive put more into it then it is worth
overall i definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop
in fact he said about 10 of their products fail
glad i eventually splashed out and quick delivery from amazon to my place of work
the graphics are great
i bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market
otherwise go with a cheaper computer or consider spending a little more for the pro
was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba
the hinges on this pc are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the pc
the case is carved out of a single block of aluminum
7expensive
when i had a boot up issue the hp recovery didnt work
i am not much of a computer techie so i can understand some ofthe internal problems though i do have trend micro as an antiviral program
pcs were just cheaper had more software and were ubiquitous
its small enough where i can take it pretty much anywhere but still has a big enough screen to get everything done
i hate to say this but if i could take this back to the shop and get my money back then i would
one thing i didt like is the stylus holder its cheap plastic and doesnt seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the usb port
i am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers
overall this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase
within the first few months that i bought it there was clearly a problem with the hard drive
its super fast and a great value for the price
fantastic machine i have never believed the hype behind apple products but must admit i am now a mac user and do not see myself going back
it is quiet runs smoothly
overall the performance and specs are definitely great for the price compared to other laptop of the same price which make this apple purchase a worthwhile one
i am currently out of town and called to inform them the broken part would be returned when i got back in town
i would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front
its so damn good i bought 2 d
the only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops i think
itunes is also you default and also your only media player besides dvd player or any other media players you may come across on the internet
it came with no instruction book no back up cds and has already crashed
i tested it it worked great
if the wifi adapter will not support duplex operation still trying to get to the bottom of that thats a noticeable drawback ill be grousing about for the entire time i use it
luckily i still have a windows based computer to use when needed
i also purchased iwork to go with it which has programs for word processing spreadsheets and presentations similar to microsoft office
unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you cant find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small
laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you a better battery
this computer is really fast and im shocked as to how easy it is to get used to
very nice
i would definitely not go back to using a pc after using the mac
i honestly love my mac thats why i am a self proclaimed mac addict
i started it up and it still has the same problem i went in to fix
the manual said that particular series of beeps indicated a video problem
you also have to press firmly on the keys
i was in a big hurry to buy a computer just to produce a newsletter for my job
the hd display is sensational and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me
from the moment i received this macbook it was like a dream come true
i simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and antivirus
my laptop cost approximately 2300 and died after only 2years 10months and 18days of use
the keyboard is too slick
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me
this computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop
i cant begin to say how disappointed i am
my daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us
i returned the 2nd laptop for a full refund
i have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available but nothing has helped
i had searched everywhere for a windows 7 laptop and all i could find was that awful windows 8
im sure i just got a bad egg but instead of getting a replacement i decided to try a different one
some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc
more than enough for my use
purchased a toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out
this one however is now very loose and i have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work then suddenly i can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own
overall though for the money spent its a great deal
device is light weight quiet during operation and produces little to no heat
it does run a little warm but that is a negligible concern
ive only had mine a day but im already used to it
i love this laptop to the moon
i purchased this laptop back in june 2015 after doing a lot of research on different laptops i was interested in
defective software
done enjoy using microsoft office
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem
no junkware
soon i will be hitting the 5 year mark and i think this thing can make it another 5 in my opinion
i did buy office 2008 for the mac at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for 64 and that was a steal in my opinion
i tried all the window updates this worked for a couple of hp laptops i7in that i bought later at bb to see if it could remove the drag it did not
i wiped nearly everything off of it installed openoffice and firefox and i am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one
i was so happy with my new mac
i find that it often gets very slow and i have to restart more than usual
after the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq
love the size i am using this for work i am a nurse and have to chart daily this is easy to use and i have not had any problems with it
i dont do any high tech stuff on it just write papers check mail and sometimes play games so i cant reccomend it if you are in the computer field
still giving it a 5 star rating because it is fast and a nice sized screen
the only thing that isnt perfect about this netbook is the speakers they are not loud at all but i expected that
i have no idea whats taking up all the room it doesnt make sense
i love this computer
i wasnt really as concerned about portability its a very large laptop but its not hard to move around or take on a trip which was a pleasant surprise
not super fancy but not super expensive either
unable to boot up this brand new laptop
now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops
i would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage
good for basic stuff
even though it is much more expensive than many pc laptops it is worth the price
i have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but i like it
now that they are not virus free l i see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower more expensive and do not last as long
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming machine
no ok were looking at a generation gaps here but yes back in the day computers didnt have cameras on them
the new macbook pro working good user experience fast speed faster start up time
purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing email etc
very nice computer
after purchasing this thing i find out that i need a special interface device to connect my camera and that it cannot be purchased at the store only on line
from time to time i get the spinning beach ball that holds up progress
yes i thought the expese was a little much but i now realize you get what you pay for
it was very easy to just pick up and use
as a graphic arts a retired instructor i still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art
most of them were either too big too noisy and too slow after 2 years
i love my apple it is quick and easy to use
disclaimer im a mac user
its great
the battery is simply considered consumable and not covered
i hooked up a usb mouse and all is well
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it
the key bindings take a little getting used to but have loved the macbook pro
breaking within 1 year of purchase and speaking to 4 people to report the damaged part will be returned late
i can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the show all bookmarks icon the open book icon at the upper left
i wasnt really sure i wanted to spend that kind of money
they went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after 2 hours on phone could not fix it
speed is great easy to set up and get going
with awesome graphics and assuring security its perfect
in the description it said there is bluetooth but no there isnt
great value laptop
it is not a small compact laptop but i wont be traveling via air often so its size and weight is not a problem for me
i appreciate the relatively large keyboard with number pad and screen size
i would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it
other than a hate of windows 8 she just loves it
great computer
first it does not have a push button to open the lid
anyway i dont use webcam much so i dont care
even though macbooks are expensive you will see that they are well worth the money
this computer is good for 10 days then it sucks for the rest of your life
i am returning it
i dot use it i think i would accidently break it and loose my stylus
the unique to apple aluminium unibody is a real beauty
impossible to use
itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with its simple to use user interface
its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes
it runs fast
when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you dont matter
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing
below average on the wfi adapter which im still trying to get to the bottom of
i am not ultra tech savvy but i can tell when it works slow
the mac is light and so compact i thought i would regret not buying a retina display not in the least the mac pro works just fine
i loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform
it is easy to use good quality and good price
its keyboard is nicely arranged silent and backlit which is nice but what i dont like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers
sound card is limited though
not a bad laptop its a bit slow but gets the job done
this laptop does everything i need it to very well
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba
this is without a doubt the worst laptop ive ever had
got this on black friday with a very good discount and couldnt be happier
well worth the extra cost
this macbook pro is amazing
this thing is a lemon
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work
the only problems are the sound isnt very loud i have to wear headphones
am very glad i bought it great netbook low price
also the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it
excellent product for the money
good laptop for the money
it want take it it keep saying error
both my husband and i have this model toshiba
the motherboard is dead
the manufacturers warranty only covers replacementrepair of parts
then 2 of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro
it runs very quiet too which is a plus
it has done everything and more that i expected
keeps freezing
really light you can carry with you everywhere
pay me now pay me lateri am happy with my choice going with this laptop
i use the computer to basically check emails surf the web print coupons and for my college papers
i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus
these are about twice the price of an equivilant windows machine so it was a tough decision but like i said i am pleased so far
i dont have any technical pearls to share
ive always sworn by dell
overall i feel this netbook was poor quality had poor performance although it did have great battery life when it did work
the hp laptops 17in with i3 core and amd i mentioned before from the other big electronic bb store smoked this one even before i updated windows and upped the ram
that being said it still runs video in full screen decently
its fast has high definition quality in the videos
excellent led monitor and well equipped
we havent had any problems with it at all
then the hard drive failed
ive had my macbook pro for three years now and still love it
paid close to 2800 out the door
they have held up well not just in our sales department but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust exhaust grease oil and all manner of other noncomputerfriendly substances
pros 1 nice looks
have used windows for years so switching takes a little adjustments but once you get used to it you wont feel like going back
i also really like the addition of the sd card slot
killer computer
not durable
it had the full sized touch pad with 2 buttons instead of just one
couple that with lack of inbuilt bluetooth dvd drive you are looking at a close tie or even a loss compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late august 2014
it gets stuck all of the time you use it and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work
i am definitely sold and not going back to pcs for home use
first the screen goes completely out
the biggest problem i have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive
i just bought this macbook pro a few weeks ago and the user interface was so simple i got used to my computer in a matter of days rather than the year it took for me to master microsoft windows 7
honestly didnt see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display so didnt fancy paying that much premium for retina others may fancy that i didnt
i love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both
just what we needed for our daughter to do her on line math class
as an added bonus i plan on upgraded to 16gb down the road but 8 will do for now
dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture
i contacted hpabout this situation and was given excuses without results
great investment
the battery is pretty soild
it took almost 20 minutes to boot up
its so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with
i cant even turn it off
other than that i love it
if you cant afford a macbook get this one
the criteria that i used to evaluate the macbook pro ranges from reliability to simple usability
i went with him and we picked this one
the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are backlit which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing typing
i have not tried gaming on it but i have heard that macapple does not do games well
though thats pretty much what your paying for a well designed device
asked the customer service rep
two times with in one month
i loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows os until this started happening
what this laptop does have is windows 8 which is confusing as all getout tons of amp34bloatwareamp34
